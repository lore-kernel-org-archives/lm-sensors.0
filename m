This is the point I'm still most concerned with, as it provides a
definite meaning to an otherwise abstract property. However, if you
believe this is sane and unlikely to be problematic, then I am happy to
leave the decision to you.

Get rid of the "Supported", that's a Linux detail.

s/Supported/expected/ ?

Given the discussion has otherwise boiled down to bits that I think can
change later, I'm happy to give my ack:

Acked-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

I'll leave it to the others to fight against this if they still have
concerns.

Thanks,
Mark.
