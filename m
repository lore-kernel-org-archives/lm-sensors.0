We're set to change a lot of files anyway, so we might as well do the
right thing now and be done with it.

I totally agree with you, Guenter. My initial reaction (which I did
post!) was exactly the same as yours. Adding a define for pr_fmt to all
drivers in the kernel tree is simply insane. If the default definition
of pr_fmt is not good enough, let's just make it better. Now. The whole
point of pr_*() and dev_*() message printing functions is to have
standard message formats common to all drivers across the tree. Not
providing a sane default value for pr_fmt goes against this goal.

As far as I can see, the only issue with defaulting to 'KBUILD_BASENAME
": " fmt' is that some drivers which include a hard-coded prefix in log
message will now have a redundant prefix. Should be easy enough to spot
and fix, right?

I would even go one step further and claim that making pr_fmt
configurable per driver is pointless. But this can be discussed
separately/later.
