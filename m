Hi Hans.

I think a lot of those driver MAINTAINERS entries are
maybe a little useful when the driver is just written
but are progressively less useful after a few months.

I once wrote a little script to look at whether or not
each listed maintainer had signed-off on a patch to
a listed file block for whatever time frame.

Most had not.

I'd rather people put their names in CREDITS than
MAINTAINERS if they want posterity entries.

I mostly agree with that, but sometimes it's useful
when the implementation is a bit complex and the
original author may still have some memory of the
complexity.

Anyway, I'm not resubmitting that patch.  If you want
to remove yourself from whatever entry, please do.
