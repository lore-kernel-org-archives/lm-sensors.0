At present, no. There is a plan to move the documentation out of the
kernel, but I'm not sure on how that's currently progressing. Some
general cleanup needs to occur before we can actually do that.

Ok. This seems to be the default assumption in many bindings, so I
shan't argue against it here, but in general we should be as precise as
possible as to the format of the devicetree.

I believe that referring to the header is fine, though personally I'd
prefer if we were explicit in binding docs. I'll leave Stephen to
comment on what the preferred way of handling header constants with
binding documents is.

Which are what exactly? What constitutes a "cooling device"?

Is "black-body radiation" [1] a valid cooling device?

How about "copper heat sink"?

Something like that could certainly work.

I think that having a zone refer to the sensors that monitor it would be
preferable. Otherwise we're encoding that way a devices output is to be
consumed on the binding for the device itself, which feels odd (it's
arguable as to whether it's a property of the device, however).

How will the devicetree writer determine this?

It's possible for the thermal management code to dynamically adjust the
rate between some extreme polling intervals based on how big a rise it
detects between polls or possibly something more complex taking into
account some metric for load.

I didn't spot this on my first round, but the trips node will need
#address-cells and #size-cells, and the sub nodes unit-addresses should
match their reg properties.

I don't see the problem here. If you don't specify a device, your only
options will be some sort of passive management.

If you have more than 32 trip points (which is admittedly unlikely), how
do you represent them? I'm not sure a mask is the best representation
here, as it's difficult for a human to match up with a list of entries.

Additionally, the trip points don't have a logical contiguous numbering
from zero, so how do the bits in the mask correspond to entries in the
list? This seems to rely on the order that the subnodes are in, which
AFAIK is not guaranteed. It would be far nicer to have an explicit
linkage.

Which is exactly why this should be the opposite way round, with thermal
zones referring to sensors in this fashion.

The way you're suggesting means that the phandle+cells specifier refers
half to the consumer and half to the producer. Having thermal zones
refer to sensors would make this refer solely to the producer (the
sensor).

I think you need the rest of the nodes in this example. You don't show
whether or not there's a cooling-device, so it's not clear that the CPU
is required to be passively cooled...

While I can see a distinction, the nomenclature is horrendously

That wasn't clear from the binding, and now I've re-read it, I'm still
not entirely clear on what the limits represent, and why you may have
multiple sets of pairs.

Definitely. We need to ensure that we fully define the relationship too

Ah. I misunderstood "fw" as "firmware", rather than "framework", and got
confused. It would be nice if you could expand "fw" to make this
clearer. :)
