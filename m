Yes, all the ports decoded by the chip should certainly be reserved,
but I think the entire range should be reserved at a higher level,
like the PNP core, and the driver should reserve only the ports it
uses.  Then the entire range is reserved even if there is no driver
or the driver is not loaded.  That's the approach we use for PCI,
e.g.,

  e8100000-e81fffff : 0000:00:08.0          <-- reserved by PCI core
    e8100000-e8102fff : CS46xx_BA1_data0    <-- reserved by driver
    e8110000-e81137ff : CS46xx_BA1_data1
    e8120000-e8126fff : CS46xx_BA1_pmem
    e8130000-e81300ff : CS46xx_BA1_reg

I agree those declarations are probably wrong.  But at least they're
larger than required, so they should be safe.

Well, I think the driver change *is* correct, assuming that the
entire range can be reserved at a higher level.  In this case,
it is, via a PNP0C02 device.

I think a DMI-based quirk to fix the PNP0C02 resources would be
a good approach, but we shouldn't do that until those resources
cause some other problem.

It is a real issue.  It's probably not very common because many ACPI
devices use "legacy" resources like ports below 0x1000, and the kernel
has heuristics to avoid placing other devices there.  But I have seen
the kernel place a CardBus device on top of an ACPI device, so it does
happen.

Apart from preventing resource conflicts, PNP has framework for
driver/device binding, suspend/resume, etc.  Without PNPACPI,
we'll fall back to PNPBIOS, but my guess is that nowadays, the
ACPI namespace is better-tested than PNPBIOS.  And I wouldn't
be surprised if PNPBIOS disappears from new boxes.

I'm sure these boxes still have PNPBIOS, so pnpacpi=off would
probably work fine.  But it feels like a bigger hammer than
necessary for this problem.
