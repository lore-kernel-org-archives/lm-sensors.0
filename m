Unless I am missing something, the problem is that there is another driver 
calling request_region() instead of request_muxed_region().

w83697hf_check_wdt() (and other drivers doing the same) should call
request_muxed_region(). Otherwise, the same problem could happen with the
caller(s) of request_region() - those calls could fail as well.
Plus, other callers of request_muxed_reason() not implementing
your retry code could end up with the same problem, ie with spurious failures.

I think we will have to find a solution which does not require retries
when calling request_muxed_region(). On the other side, others know
this code much better than I do, so maybe someone has a better solution.

Thanks,
Guenter
