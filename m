Makes sense.  There will probably be quite a few IIO drivers over the next
few months doing much the same as sht15, where the voltage ref for devices
may well be fed by a regulator.  In that case, we may only offer the option
of using an external v_ref if the regulator is available.  Many devices have
an internal regulator to provide it so typically we'll start them up using that
and provide an interface to switch to external regulator if one is available.
I haven't thought through exactly how this will work as yet. I'll cc people in
when this comes up.

Thanks,

Jonathan
