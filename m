Yes, we can disable this config, but it will disable all hwmon interface
which registered by the thermal fw, it may affect other driver.

Ok, I think I can post it as a separate patches.

lm90.c is the driver for all LM90 register compatible chips, it probe 1
device, and normally it can expose local and remote sensor, and for
max669x chip, it also expose remote2 sensor.

Yes, agreed, we need a way to determine it.
I have tentative suggestions, how about following:
lm90 {
  ...
  thermal_zone@0 {
    type = "local_sensor";
    ...
  }
  thermal_zone@1 {
    type = "remote_sensor";
  }
}
And in the driver's probe routine, we can parse the thermal_zone node,
and pass it to thermal_zone_of_device_register() with the right .get_temp().
