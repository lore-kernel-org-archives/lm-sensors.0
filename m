I do also excuse for my delay, as I was also "engaged" for a week or so.

Not really! quite the opposite. Although I was looking at some other
stuff, I got this series also tested on different boards and wrote down
a couple of improvements I will be working in the coming days. Indeed,
it is worth moving forward with this work.

The string is supposed to carry meaning, yes. Couple of common used:

In this case, I believe CPUfreq driver must be thermal aware in this
case. And we need to cook a way to, whenever there is such link, the
cpufreq driver instantiates the cooling mechanism. But I need to think a
little bit more on this, will come back on this point soon.

Ok. My point was just that linking objects without telling when (in
temperature domain) to start using this link, may be incomplete, because
trip points are really HW dependent, because your power dissipation
profile changes from HW design to HW design. In other words, one can
say, "use device fan to cool the GPU", but depending on your GPU, you
may start using your fan when the sensor is 100C, 85C, 110C (just
picking numbers), it is really HW dependent. Besides, the same IP may be
used immersed in different ambient condition, which may cause variance
on its leakage level, and thus changes its thermal dissipation profile,
resulting in different trip points. Thus, mapping all this HW
characteristics inside specific drivers does not sound the right path to
me. That is why I believe pointing which trips to use is part of HW
description.

I must agree that, saying which governor  to use, then again, is pure
policy definition though.

I will go through our discussion, consider the points risen and repost
the series as soon as possible. I will not let this one fall into the
cracks, no worries.

Thanks for your inputs, BTW.
