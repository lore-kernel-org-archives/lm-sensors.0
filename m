Subject: [lm-sensors] [PATCH V2 0/6] thermal: exynos: Add kernel thermal support for exynos platform

Changes since V1:
*Moved the sensor driver to driver/thermal folder from driver/hwmon folder
 as suggested by Mark Brown and Guenter Roeck 
*Added notifier support to notify the registered drivers of any cpu cooling
 action. The driver can modify the default cooling behaviour(eg set different
 max clip frequency).
*The percentage based frequency replaced with absolute clipped frequency.
*Some more conditional checks when setting max frequency.
*Renamed the new trip type THERMAL_TRIP_STATE_ACTIVE to
 THERMAL_TRIP_STATE_INSTANCE
*Many review comments from R, Durgadoss <durgadoss.r@intel.com> and 
 eduardo.valentin@ti.com implemented.
*Removed cooling stats through debugfs patch
*The V1 based can be found here,

 http://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/3/32

Changes since RFC:
*Changed the cpu cooling registration/unregistration API's to instance based
*Changed the STATE_ACTIVE trip type to pass correct instance id
*Adding support to restore back the policy->max_freq after doing frequency 
  clipping.
*Moved the trip cooling stats from sysfs node to debugfs node as suggested
  by Greg KH greg@kroah.com 
*Incorporated several review comments from eduardo.valentin@ti.com
*Moved the Temperature sensor driver from driver/hwmon/ to driver/mfd
 as discussed with Guenter Roeck <guenter.roeck@ericsson.com> and 
 Donggeun Kim <dg77.kim@samsung.com> (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/5/7)
*Some changes according to the changes in common cpu cooling APIs
*The RFC based patches can be found here,

Brief Description:

1) The generic cooling devices code is placed inside driver/thermal/* as 
placing inside acpi folder will need un-necessary enabling of acpi code. This
codes is architecture independent.

2) This patchset adds a new trip type THERMAL_TRIP_STATE_INSTANCE which passes
cooling device instance number and may be helpful for cpufreq cooling devices
to take the correct cooling action. This trip type avoids the temperature
comparision check again inside the cooling handler.

3) This patchset adds generic cpu cooling low level implementation through
frequency clipping and cpu hotplug. In future, other cpu related cooling
devices may be added here. An ACPI version of this already exists
(drivers/acpi/processor_thermal.c). But this will be useful for platforms
like ARM using the generic thermal interface along with the generic cpu
cooling devices. The cooling device registration API's return cooling device
pointers which can be easily binded with the thermal zone trip points.
The important APIs exposed are,
   a)struct thermal_cooling_device *cpufreq_cooling_register(
	struct freq_clip_table *tab_ptr, unsigned int tab_size,
	const struct cpumask *mask_val)
   b)void cpufreq_cooling_unregister(struct thermal_cooling_device *cdev)

4) Samsung exynos platform thermal implementation is done using the generic
cpu cooling APIs and the new trip type. The temperature sensor driver present
in the hwmon folder(registered as hwmon driver) is moved to thermal folder
and registered as a thermal driver.

All this patchset is based on Kernel version 3.3-rc7 

A simple data/control flow diagrams is shown below,
