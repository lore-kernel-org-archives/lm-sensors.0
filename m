I have no idea, really. I have seen multiple patches flying around,
each seems to have its own merits, but I simply don't know which is
going in the direction. I don't know a thing about regulators, OF, DT
etc. so I am really not the right person to make a decision about this.

All I can say is: either someone comes up with a patch set which
properly fixes the regression for all lm90 drivers users, or I will have
to revert commit 3e0f964f.
