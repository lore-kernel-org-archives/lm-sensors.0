Hi Sjoerd,

Thanks for your feedback and sorry for a late reply.

I'm OK to change the default-pulse-width to be similar to
"default-brightness-level" (as it is in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/backlight/pwm-backlight.txt)

I'd prefer to keep the indirection - as it is utilized in the current
pwm-fan.c driver.

Your assumption is correct. cooling-pwm-values are indeed in the
[0..255] range. I will add this information in v2.

I agree.

Enabling pan to full RPM was the default behaviour in the current
pwm-fan.c file.

To be honest, there is no need to enable fan to full RPM speed in this
board for following reasons:
1. In Odroid the FAN is optional (stacked on top of a heat sink) - very
often it is just enough to only have the heat sink.

2. Odroid has thermal enabled by default and IMHO it would be more
feasible to allow thermal to control fan from the very beginning.

However, I can also understand if the policy for hwmon implies a rule
to enable by default all fans to full RPM speed.
