Sure. My bad. I did not provide enough information in this RFC. Thanks for
your patience !=20


The current hwmon driver ibmpowernv relies on a device tree provided by=20
the OPAL firmware. Today, this tree has the following layout :

	ibm,opal/sensors/
	|-- amb-temp#1-data
	|   |-- compatible
	|   |-- linux,phandle
	|   |-- name
	|   |-- phandle
	|   `-- sensor-id
	|-- amb-temp#1-thrs
	|   |-- compatible
	|   |-- linux,phandle
	|   |-- name
	|   |-- phandle
	|   `-- sensor-id
	|-- cooling-fan#10-data
	|   |-- compatible
	|   |-- linux,phandle
	|   |-- name
	|   |-- phandle
	|   `-- sensor-id
	|-- cooling-fan#10-faulted
	|   |-- compatible
	|   |-- linux,phandle
	|   |-- name
	|   |-- phandle
	|   `-- sensor-id
	|-- cooling-fan#10-thrs
	|   |-- compatible
	|   |-- linux,phandle
	|   |-- name
	|   |-- phandle
	|   `-- sensor-id
	...

It has some limitations and we want to change it to something more flexible=
,=20
giving us the ability to add new sensors. The new device tree layout is=20
described here :

	https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/skiboot/2015-February/000457.html


Both layouts use the same root node "ibm,opal/sensors" but the underlying
nodes have nothing in common, which means that the current driver ibmpowernv
will not 'see' any sensors on a system with an OPAL firmware exposing the n=
ew=20
device tree. One will need new code for it.=20

We have a few options to add support for this new tree :

 1. modify the current driver to parse the two trees. It seems overly compl=
ex=20
    and the resulting code will be a pain to maintain.=20

 2. add a new driver. As the two drivers can cohabitate, it is a viable sol=
ution.
    We will let the old driver rot in its corner and deprecate it one day. =
Kind
    of ugly to keep this code around.

 3. replace the current driver with a new one. The simplest and most brutal=
 but=20
    it also means we loose sensor support for IBM P8 systems running the ol=
d OPAL=20
    firmware. I don't think it is a problem as these systems are bound to u=
pdate=20
    their firmware due to the amount of development currently being done on=
 the=20
    OPAL side.

    Open Power systems are not impacted.


Is that clearer ? and I would go for option 3.

Thanks,

C.
