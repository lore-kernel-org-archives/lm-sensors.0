Well, at least we are keeping it up somehow. I just would like to have
an agreement, at least for the binding part, as I mentioned before.

OK. I will try to clarify that.

I understand. But I also could not find a better naming. We use the term
'cooling binding'. However, while rewriting and rereading this binding
document  I realized that the 'binding' term could be confused between
'cooling binding' and 'device tree binding'. So I chose to use another
name and 'attachments' as the best I could come out with :-). I am open
to suggestions here, if you have something better.

Well, idea was to have all these entries uniform. Besides, making sure
one has added a #sensor-cells entry to a device tree node seams to be
sign that the writer of that node really wants it to be a temperature
sensor used within this type of binding.

It is just a state to describe the level of cooling provided. I tried to
explained it in the above paragraph, but based on your comment, it was
not enough :-).

A fan device may come with three different speeds. Then it would be seen
as having three cooling levels. Similarly, a cpu may come with four
operating points (predefined pairs of voltage and frequency set), then
it would be seen as having four cooling levels. Pretty straight forward.

>=20
> How does this relate to cooling-cells? These seem to be a fixed size.
>=20

The cooling cells was simply to say which levels would be used. E.g. If
a cpu has 10 different operating points, at a certain trip point, the
designer may choose only the 6th until the 10th operating point
available to cool off the thermal zone.

Yes, they take only one cell. And yes, so far I see only one need so
far, to describe min and max level used while referring to the cooling
device.

Well, I haven't seen such case. But would make sense to me, yes. Not
that we would be using though.

Can you please be more specific? Any counter example on how to be less
flexible? I believe this shall give a good level of flexibility. Nothing
less than needed, and nothing that can open for abusing the notation.

Signed. But withing the current code implementation, and design too, we
are concerned with high positive temperatures, not low negative
temperatures.

I think this is a matter of taste. I am not sure I see the advantage of
changing this to string constants. If it is the case of having better
readability, I would say we do not loose readability while using macros,
that is descriptive enough.

Well, I thought of having a list at first, but then we would loose the
'contribution' property, which is specific to a cooling device, not to a
list of cooling devices.

I think I do not follow this suggestion properly. Can you please give an
example? The parameters I was referring to was just the min and max
cooling levels.

Well not exactly an average, but at least a linear relation, as already
mentioned. Not only that, but with the above property, one can use also
one single sensor + offset, which is a very common use case.

Yes, that is exactly what I meant. And that is why I have been saying
that I see these polling values are part of hardware description. Worst
case is when device unexpectedly cross several trip boundaries between
polls without the system seeing, but also reaches temperature ranges
that compromise silicon lifetime or internal structures.

These is highly bound to maximum power delta that the circuitry may be
exposed to.

In the case the CPU is DVFS-capable, which is pretty common case these
days, they represent that the referred cpu has four possible operating
points. In this case, 0 means the maximum operating point, 3 means the
minimum operating point.

No, this is not about the work the OS capability of doing work on a CPU.
This is more tied to the frequency and voltage available on a CPU. That
is, the hardware capability of cooling itself, in this case.

I am not sure what you mean here, same level of cooling applies for a
cpu capable of doing dvfs, for instance.

Regarding the implementation for Linux, I proposed a function that
parses all of them, when the thermal framework is initialized. They will
be represented as thermal zone devices in the thermal framework. But
they will only be enabled when the sensor drivers register themselves to
the framework.

Same reason I mentioned for not having a list of cooling devices in each
attachment, we could loose information specific to the attachment trip,
cooling device.

Same example I answered above, one cooling device that has 10 levels of
cooling can be used at trip point at 100C only from 6th to 10th cooling
level. And on different trip point, from 4th to 5th, and so on so forth..=

Which useless data? The allocated data is used to hold the parsed data
which in turn is used to make the thermal zone device work properly.
They are freed when the thermal framework is unloaded, in which each
thermal zone device is unregistered and all related data is freed, see
