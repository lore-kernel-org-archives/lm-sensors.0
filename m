I agree that we surely can rip off unused properties if they turn out to
be not helping at all. On the min/max specific case, I do have board
that investigation (by experimentation on real board and simulation)
showed that, for instance, allowing maximum power delta can cause burst
on temperature, and those bursts are hard to detect on higher levels of
temperature domain. Well, it turns out that this is essentially how
temperature behaves.  Obviously, behavior on different boards is also
different, or at least produce different bursts. It would require
drivers to have board knowledge in order to properly report this.

As it has been already discussed during the development of this work,
one can also develop a PID controller to minimize the board dependency.
However, the board dependency can only be minimized, not avoided, as not
all board have needed sensors, say power, current sensor, or not enough
temperature sensors, and power estimation based only on cpu load is
known to not be strongly correlated to overall board power dissipation.

The proposal of using min max on trip point is not coming from nowhere.
