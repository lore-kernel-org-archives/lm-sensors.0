My use case is primarily for hwmon drivers.

hwmon has a separate API call to register a driver with the hwmon subsystem,
which creates a separate hwmon device and provides the user space notification.
As the created attribute files are often conditional on device variant and device
configuration, I don't see how this could be done through a default attribute
list (even though it might be worthwhile exploring if it can be used for some
of the simpler drivers).

The idea was to also provide devm_hwmon_register and devm_hwmon_unregister.
Together that would help us reducing the remove function for most hwmon
drivers to pretty much nothing.

Some other subsystems:

usb: Used widely. From looking into a couple of sources, usage seems to be
questionable, as I don't see how userspace would be notified. I don't know
enough about usb to be sure, though.

mtd: One use case (volume creation) seems to be safe, as it notifies userspace
about its completion. For UBI I am not that sure, as it registers the device
first and then adds the attributes.

regulators: No idea if it does the right thing.

input: Usage in files I looked at seems questionable.

There are others, but it really gets murky and I don't understand
the subsystems well enough to make a call.

I think hwmon is a valid use case.

For other subsystems, I simply don't know enough about those to do that kind
of work; I think it would make more sense to ask it to be done by people who
are familiar with the respective subsystems or drivers to do it.

Besides, looking through well above 1,000 calls would probably take about
forever if a single person was to do it, even if that person would be available
full-time to do the work.

How about an alternative: Provide the API, then if/when people start using it
wrongly ask them to fix up the drivers instead. That seems to make more sense
to me.

Thanks,
Guenter
