I thought about that when I started working on the driver, but concluded that 
it does not really make sense.

The chip is commonly used to control all supply voltages on a board.
Changing those voltages is not a good idea. For that reason, the chip can be 
set into read-only mode, where changing the voltages is no longer possible
after initial programming.

While it is theoretically possible that someone might use the device to control
not only fixed but also dynamic voltages, I think that is highly unlikely, given
the risk involved in blowing up the board. Thus, moving the driver to mfd would 
effectively serve no real purpose other than to cause confusion and add unnecessary
complexity.
