Hi Hans and Jean, 

Thanks for your responses.

Hmm.. Going to be interesting coming up with a name!   Guess that can 
come at a
later stage anyway.

Definitely agreed that it makes sense to put DACs and ADCs in the same 
general place
and obviously there are plenty of devices out there that do both.

It would indeed by stretching the point to make drivers in that 
subsystem have more performance
critical drivers!  We seem to have a consensus that neither hwmon or 
i2c/chips is good idea.

Although I don't know much about the input subsystem it doesn't seem 
likely that all the devices
we are considering would share all that much functionality with the 
devices in there, particularly if
as you have suggested, we include DACs.

Ok, so the consensus so far is we are looking at a new subsystem.  Will 
give this a few more days
on the lists, then if the consensus is still heading that way, I'll have 
a think about exact functionality
this would need.  I guess it would be something that would probably 
evolve for some time, centered
around an initial half dozen or so drivers.

Thanks for all your comments,
