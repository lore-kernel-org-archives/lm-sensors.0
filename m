I spent some time implementing two variants of devm_hwmon_device_register().
One is based on the patchset provided here, and uses the following API.

struct device *devm_hwmon_device_register(struct device *dev);

The other is

struct device *devm_hwmon_device_register(struct device *dev, struct
					  attribute_group **groups);

The second API includes a pointer to the sysfs attribute groups, and creates the
sysfs attributes within the API call. With this approach, conditional attributes
are managed with is_visible.

I then converted a couple of drivers to the new APIs.

For the first approach, conversion was quite simple:
	device_create_file -> devm_device_create_file
	sysfs_create_group -> devm_sysfs_create_group
	hwmon_device_register -> devm_hwmon_device_register
and drop all remove calls.

Result for the lm90 driver as a medium complexity example:

 drivers/hwmon/lm90.c |   46 +++++++++++++---------------------------------
 1 file changed, 13 insertions(+), 33 deletions(-)

The object size is reduced by approximately 500 bytes (of 20k).

Result for max16065 driver:

 drivers/hwmon/max16065.c |   52 +++++++++++-----------------------------------
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+), 40 deletions(-)

Code size is reduced by approximately 450 bytes (of 12k).

For the second approach, I had to convert sysfs groups to use is_visible,
create new groups where those did not exist, implement is_visible functions,
drop calls to device_create_file, sysfs_create_group, and drop the remove
functions.

Result for the lm90 driver:
 drivers/hwmon/lm90.c |  137 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--------------------
 1 file changed, 83 insertions(+), 54 deletions(-)

The object size increases by about 200 bytes.

Results for max16065 driver:

 drivers/hwmon/max16065.c |  142 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++--------------------
 1 file changed, 80 insertions(+), 62 deletions(-)

Code size increases by about 160 bytes.

This is after I pulled all tricks I could find to reduce the code size increase.
In both cases, the code ended up being less readable and more confusing
than before, as the validation if an attribute has to be created or not
is now spread across multiple is_visible functions and no longer
in a single block of code, and it is more difficult to understand if an
attribute will be created or not.

For simple drivers which don't need is_visible, the resulting code is
similar with both approaches. Unfortunately, most hwmon drivers are not
that simple. As soon as conditional attributes are needed, the code ends up
being more complex.

In conclusion, I see the second approach (ie using is_visible) as a no-go.
The idea is to reduce complexity, not to increase it. So, ultimately, we can
discuss how the API functions are named and its parameters, but for the hwmon
subsystem conversion to devres to make sense we would need the device/sysfs
API functions along the line I proposed. Otherwise we are better off with
just keeping the current hwmon API and not bother converting it to devres.

Thanks,
Guenter
