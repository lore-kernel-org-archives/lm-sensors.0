This sounds like a good plan, rather then add a new bus type add a superio 
platform driver which does superio probing and registering of platform devices 
for discovered logical devices.

This superio platform driver then needs to also export some functions of those 
few logical devices which need access to the superio registers for more then 
just finding out their own base address.

I guess that it then would be best to load this superio driver by default on 
most systems.

How does this all mix and match with isapnp, it feels to me we're doing 
somewhat the same as isapnp here.

Hans
