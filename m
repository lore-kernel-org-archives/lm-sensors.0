I agree with this approach, as it can properly serve the purpose of
fixing this specific issue. The only drawback here is the fact that we
need to add this change to every possible user of this API. If you want
to push this fix via hwmon, you can add my
Acked-by: Eduardo Valentin <eduardo.valentin@ti.com>

and I request Rui to drop the patch I sent earlier.

Now, other issue is the fact that the thermal framework config entry
needs to be revisited, despite the link to this issue. As I mentioned in
other email thread, there are other system requirements that may prevent
proper usage of the thermal framework as a module. This is, I know,
another topic, and it shall be discussed in a different thread.

You have got to be excited about what you are doing. (L. Lamport)
