What I had in mind was more like my Linux-based portable media player.
No local user and no networking capabilities, so hardware monitoring is
pointless, while thermal management may be desirable.

Doesn't mean it's right ;)

Good point.

I like it, I think I'll do that, thanks for the suggestion.

Not sure what "notion" you are referring to, but this particular piece
of code isn't that old. There are a lot of config-dependent pieces of
code in the kernel tree, and I don't think this is a problem. The
problem I have here is with the implementation details and their
consequences. Same as including header files which you don't need, it
causes useless rebuilds. Furthermore, the fact that unsetting (or
setting) CONFIG_HWMON will cause a kABI breakage for all users of
thermal is pretty nasty for distributions. I would like to fix this (in
a different patch, of course.)
