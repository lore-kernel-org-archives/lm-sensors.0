OK. We ported an old RTC driver for the Epson RX8025 for our board. 
Unfortunately, it did not use the new bindings but I fixed that in the 
meantime. It will be posted for kernel inclusion soon.

I see. My problem is that I2C_CLASS_HWMON is set in the I2C bus driver 
for the MPC:

   http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.26/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-mpc.c#L314

If I disable it, the LM75 driver only probes the addresses of the I2C 
nodes defined in the FDT DTS file. I wonder if this should not be the 
default behaviour for kernels using OF platform description. For this 
reason, I have put Linuxppc-dev ML on CC. I also realized, that there 
are some patches for OF I2C pending. I will check.

Wolfgang.
