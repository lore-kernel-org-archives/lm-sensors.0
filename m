This is a generic purpose platform, the GPIO bus is exposed on an
external DB25 connector. End-users can use it however they like.

Both in fact. For instance, we are connecting an SHT15
humidity/temperature sensor, which already has support in the kernel.

Exactly.

Thanks.

I've been working on pushing this code mainline for a while. To
summarize, for you to accept this code, you'd prefer me to move every
symbol into the driver itself (in addition to addressing your and Joe's
other requests), and then we're good?
