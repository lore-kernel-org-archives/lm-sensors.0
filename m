As in "a name"? So, for example "The board", "PSU"? What I meant to ask
was: does the string carry any meaning?

Cool, I believe it is the right thing to do.

"virtual concepts"... This is where my problem lies... It's not hardware
so it doesn't seem to belong in the tree at the first sight. Shouldn't
it focus on "physical data" instead? As in: point at devices that have
some impact on the conditions? For example, you can say "please, do the
right thing to cool your environment down" to both CPU and fan, can't
you? The "cooling driver" for the CPU would know that it has to slow
down, while a driver for the fan would know that it has to speed up ;-)

What I'm trying to say is that in my opinion the tree should simply link
the object, the sensor and the actuator. Nothing more, nothing less.

Thanks for your time!
