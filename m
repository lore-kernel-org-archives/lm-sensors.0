Of course.

I understood that this is only true for the HWMON devices. Why the 
special treatment?

Yep, as probing might not be acceptable in some cases, I makes sense to 
add a property to suppress probing:

		i2c@3000 {
			...
			compatible = "fsl-i2c";
			dfsrr;
			no-probing;
			rtc@32 {
				compatible = "epson,rx8025";
				reg = <0x32>;
			};
			dtt@4c {
				compatible = "dallas,ds75";
				reg = <0x4c>;
			};
		};

I'm going to prepare a patch for that purpose.

Wolfgang.
