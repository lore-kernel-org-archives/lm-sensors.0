I see. Something like the previous DT binding? My previous proposal was
using sub-nodes.

By means of the trip phandle. It would mean once the trip is crossed, it
is expected to modulate the cooling device between the specified limits.

They were not specified in this example, because previous discussions
suggested that we shall not represent cooling devices as dt nodes as
they are virtual. Those would be part of the cooling device node, in the
case we want to have cooling devices nodes and property in DT.

Because not all hardware have power sensors and deriving power vs.
temperature vs. time is not a simple task, specially based on estimates,
say on cpu load. Remember that we are not only talking about CPU
temperature here, there are other heat sources. Same load has different
consumption on different HW, how SW is supposed to find that out wihtout
proper sensing?

Those are based on instant measurements.

I believe it is just a matter of representation. Using either a list or
subnodes would imply that one would need to add links to fan device
twice, one in each thermal zone (it does not matter if inside a subnode
or inside a list).

Then we need to have cooling device nodes, even if they are virtual.

One way to go is to add a property to describe the linear relation

Well, I can write another RFC based on this discussion, for sure. I just
want to know what really blocks this work, that is why I sent the
examples above. But it does not seam we are progressing, looks like we
are move discussing in circles.

Cooling devices seams to be bouncing back and forward. I can send an RFC
considering:
i) addition of cooling devices virtual device nodes
ii) description of used cooling devices inside thermal zones by means of
sub-nodes, instead of lists

Pooling intervals seams to be also a loose lace. To me it is a matter of
choosing a good way to avoid missing events. We can either get the info
from HW simulation / experimentation based on HW itself or we can rely
on SW and assume SW can handle to see all events based on loose info
(assume that sw can be smart to do a self adaptive closed loop control
system based on no defined set of inputs). Both solutions are doable,
except that one may be closer to reality than the other. Also, one is
based on HW info and the other forces sw to deduce HW info. If you can
provide info that your proposal has strong evidence to be closer to
reality, I am find to signed it off.

All best,


Eduardo.
