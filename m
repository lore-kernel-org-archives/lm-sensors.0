Hi Bjorn,

Sorry for the late answer.

Thomas Renninger's patch set should handle this case. It's in -mm at the
moment and I guess we'll merge most of it in 2.6.25.

How do I see if a given motherboard does this or not? For example I
have a motherboard here that says:

0290-029f : pnp 00:04

How do I know if this is a "PNP0C02 motherboard device" I am supposed
not to touch, or a device that I can attach a native hwmon driver to?
And more importantly, how does the it87 driver (or any other hwmon
driver) know about it? I'm all for updating the hwmon drivers to
cooperate better with PNP in order to prevent clashes between the BIOS
and the OS, but I just don't know how I am supposed to do that.

I agree then. I don't think this has much to do with PNP though. What
this is calling for is a Super-I/O subsystem that detects the Super-I/O
and instantiate devices out of it. That way the drivers for these
devices (in particular hardware monitoring drivers, watchdog drivers,
some parport drivers...) would no longer need to instantiate their
devices themselves, thus matching the device driver model much better.
I've seen patches float around but so far I could never find the time
to look into them (and I fear it's unlikely to change anytime soon.)

Even under Windows, I pretty much doubt that any monitoring application
cares about what the BIOS says. Motherboard vendor applications have
enough information about each board model to know what they can do or
not without asking the BIOS. Third-party applications probably just
poke at known I/O locations (pretty much like the Linux hwmon drivers
do) and hope for the best.

I'm not aware of such a problem either.
