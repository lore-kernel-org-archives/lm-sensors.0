This patch set replaces my previous one.
(see http://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg994446.html)

Power control of the chip is dropped out since it requires more work.
Runtime-pm support was requested and that takes some time to implement
and test. I'll send it as a separate patch.

patches 1 - 3 are not touched compared to patch set 1 and they
are marked as tested-by Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de> and
acked-by ���ric Piel <eric.piel@tremplin-utc.net>.
Patch 4 is marked as tested-by Daniel Mack <daniel@caiaq.de>.

  lis3: Add skeletons for interrupt handlers
No functional changes. Changed due to rebasing and power control
removal.

  lis3: Interrupt handlers for 8bit wakeup and click events
As requested, BTN_ events are enabled only for 8 bit device and
when click event is configured to the HW.
Remapping of the BTN_ axis done according to platform data.

  lis3: Setup poll interval limits
Poll interval can now be set from 1 - 2000 ms and also to stopped state
via input-dev sysfs. 

Tested in 2.6.32 based environment. Applies to 2.6.33-RC8


Samu Onkalo (6):
  lis3: Add missing constants for 8bit device
  lis3: Separate configuration function for 8 bit device
  lis3: Introduce platform data for second ff / wu unit
  lis3: Add skeletons for interrupt handlers
  lis3: Interrupt handlers for 8bit wakeup and click events
  lis3: Setup poll interval limits
