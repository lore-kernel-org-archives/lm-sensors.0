It isn't. Other parts need a different value to be written for on/off.
However, that does not mean we need a chip specific _function_ to write
the values. All we should need is the values to write for on/off.

Values should work, and the writes should all be banked, but a flag is
unfortunately insufficient. You should include a per-page flag to enable
the functionality (something like PMBUS_HAVE_REGULATOR). Some PMBus chips
don't have regulators on all pages.

If you use per-page flags and values, you should not need those
at all.
