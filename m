That was indeed true, thanks for noticing this.

done.

It's really low, though the VIA Nano on my desk has 30 degrees C and doesn't
need a fan.  Only during kernel compiles it goes to something like 40
centigrade.

Some older C7 (Model A) had an errata where the temperature sensors had a
really high error on low temperatures.

There is also another errata with that C7 Model A, where if you underclock
the FSB of the CPU, the temperature reading would be wrong (but much too
high in that case).

Since there really is nothing we can do in software to fix this, I didn't
put any of this in the driver.  What I could do though is some bits to
add a printk() message once you load the driver on such a system.

done.  Please find an incremental patch right here:

I'll re-submit the full driver after adding the above-mentioned printk.
