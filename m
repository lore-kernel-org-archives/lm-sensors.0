Hi Ben,

Firstly thanks for taking a look at this.

At the current time at least the purpose of events in this subsystem is rather
different from those in say the input system.  So far they have all
corresponded to things that don't actually have any data associated with them.

The list so far is:
Ring bufer 50% full, Ring buffer 75% full (due to the support for escalating
events, only the highest of these will ever be in the queue).

Motion detected, device dependent on whether this is for specific axis.

Thresholds breached.

Tap detection (common on accelerometers)

Anyhow I did originally start our with a similar layout to you have suggested
(based in input subsystem) but removed it for now as it is currently unecessary.

Not necessarily, hence the TODO.  I've been wondering about using an approach
similar to the 'scan' modes seen in the max1363 driver in which the time stamp
will simply be another 'input' recorded to the ring buffer as necessary.  Within
the event structure, this is certainly something that needs to be configurable.

Oops, I'll clean them up. Thanks for pointing that out.

Good point.

Yes, definitely need to get rid of most of them.
[ring buffer code]

I definitely should have put together some more explanatory documents explaining
the aims and approach taken for the ring buffer handling. I'll get some initial
stuff writen and posted here shortly.

Thanks for taking a look and your suggestions,
