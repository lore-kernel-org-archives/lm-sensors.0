It should (at least in theory) be very simple for anything like a simple
hwmon device on which one wants to do polled reads.

All you do is allocate an iio_dev, set up the channel descriptions,
register it with the core.  Then a map is used to match supplied
channels to their consumers in kernel.

There is a simple hwmon driver that then takes one of these maps if
you want conventional hwmon interfaces.  Other interested drivers can
have their own maps.

Anyhow, IIO is complex for some devices, but pretty simple for simple
things (at least it should be!)
