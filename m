The AppleSMC contains two char[32] keys, OSK0 and OSK1, which are not
reported in the key count and index by default. These keys are used by
the OS X boot sequence, and normally don't matter when running Linux.

This patch creates a sysfs entry which reports the value of these keys
as an ASCII string, to help emulators (such as QEMU) load OS X when
running on genuine Apple hardware.

I believe this second version addresses your stylistic objections.

As Alex pointed out, hardcoding the OSK in any open-source project
might lead to legal/copyright related issues, whereas simply reporting
whatever the the hardware happens to contain should keep everyone safe.

As for struct applesmc_node_group info_group[]:

I figured "info_group" for the "least bad" place to put the OSK, given
that it's more or less "information from/about the SMC". If you could be
persuaded by the above arguments to accept the patch, and have a better
place in mind, I'd be happy to move it there...

Thanks again,
 Gabriel
