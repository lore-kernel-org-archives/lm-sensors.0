Actually I can't seem to find it in my mail archive, but I remember you
were saying that it shouldn't spoil into the driver base code. You're
probably right, so the updated patch will be limited to of_platform_*
API.

Grant was suggesting that I shouldn't be using the device model if I
have to initialize some early stuff. The thing is that my stuff is not
that early at all. The device model works for me perfectly, as long as I
can initialize 3 crucial devices in a correct order (and *then* do mass
population). And the init levels are perfect for this job. The only
thing I need is a small refinement in the way DT-based devices are
populated and this is exactly what I propose. Hope it makes more sense
now.

Cheers!

Pawel
