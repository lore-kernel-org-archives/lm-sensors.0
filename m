I'd still be distributing the copyrighted string. I don't expect
encryption to placate the proverbial lawyers, nor the project/distro
maintainers who want to avoid them :)

Plus, now I'd also be taking on the responsibility of deciding when
it's (legally) OK to let QEMU boot OS X and when it isn't.

Besides, the most obvious Apple-only key that fits your description
is the OSK itself ! :)

OK, so if we agree that for legal-CYA reasons we must pretend to
ignore the constant-ness of the key value, are we now talking about
simply where in the sysfs hierarchy to place the node that will
spit it out ?

Right now it's under /sys/devices/platform/applesmc.768/
(i.e., it's a device, it's platform specific, and it's name is
applesmc-something).

The only ties to "hwmon" are that:
	- there's a "/sys/class/hwmon/hwmonX" symlink to the above
	  directory (among others, such as the graphics card and two
	  instances of "coretemp", at least on my MacPro5,1);
	- *most* of the files in it are indeed reporting sensor
	  readings;
	- the applesmc.c device driver source file itself lives under
	  drivers/hwmon/ in the kernel source tree.

Is it common practice to split off a subset of the values reported
by such a chip and make them show up elsehere (i.e. besides the
/sys/devices/platform/<chipname> folder) ? Does the relative size
of the subsets involved count as input into that decision proces ? :)

I personally don't know enough to have an opinion on where the best
place for this might be. You suggested "/sys/firmware/smc/", and I'd
be perfectly happy with that one too. Do you know who would decide
whether that's an acceptable alternative to /sys/devices/platform/applesmc ?

Thanks again,
