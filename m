Specified accuracy range for the external diode is up to 125 degrees C.

Jean, do you have an opinion here ? I just don't think the added complexity
is worth the theoretical gain in functionality.

You could set it to some value and see what happens.

Two bad or wrong implementations don't make it a good one. If the value can be
configured into the lm95241, the code should do it.

The lm90 driver tries to find the closest match, which would be one way to go
and is what I usually do. Another possibility would be to select the next larger
valid interval.

Um ... that wasn't a review. Just browsing through the code ;).

Another thing I noticed: You are re-configuring the chip during initialization.
This is even though the chip may already have been configured through ROMMON and/or BIOS,
and specifically overrides the external sensor type. That is not a good idea; even
though it may make sense in your application, it may screw up chip configuration
for other users of the chip.

If your BIOS/Firmware does not configure the chip, and you really have to do it
in the driver, one option would be to provide configuration data through optional
platform data.

Thanks,
Guenter
