By "ACPI variables," do you mean PM1a_EVT_BLK and the like?  Those
should be subsets of the _CRS resources for some device.

I agree with this.  I know some of these native drivers (lm-sensors, etc)
are pretty essential right now.  But they just aren't safe because they
use resources that ACPI thinks it owns.  I think the drivers should be
changed to explicitly override (with appropriate KERN_WARN messages)
any prior ACPI resource reservations.

I think the PNP core should request all the ports the device responds
to (as reported by the BIOS).  The driver should request only the ports
it uses.  If the rtc driver only uses two ports, there's no reason for
it to request all eight.

IMO, this is backwards.  "pnp 00:07" should be the parent and should
be reserved by the PNP core.  A side-effect of this is that
drivers/pnp/system.c would not be needed at all.

How about something like this:  We fix all the native drivers we know
about.  We make the PNP and ACPI cores request resources for all active
devices by default, but add a flag like "pnp=no_reservations" that turns
this off.  Then native drivers that request conflicting resources
will fail, but the user can limp along by using the boot-time option.
