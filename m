I interpreted the doc the same way Randy did when I did the m41t00 chip 
code.  Also, Mark Studebaker seemed to support that interpretation in 
this email: http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg29325.html

I suppose the best thing to do is check if the adapter is a true i2c 
ctlr (something like: i2c_check_functionality(adapter, I2C_FUNC_I2C)) 
and base the cmds used on that.

We can do something similar with I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_I2C_BLOCK & 
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_BLOCK_DATA to check if we can use the smbus block 
cmds too, correct?
