Machines I have here have an "ISA bridge" PCI device. Some of them have
"LPC" in their name, but not all, and anyway the kernel only knows the
device ID, not its user-friendly name:

VIA:
00:11.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8237 ISA bridge [KT600/K8T800/K8T890 South]

Intel:
00:01.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 ISA (rev 01)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801CAM ISA Bridge (LPC) (rev 01)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) LPC Interface Bridge (rev 02)

nVidia:
00:01.0 ISA bridge: nVidia Corporation nForce2 ISA Bridge (rev a4)

One of these machines has a LPC bridge but no (detected) Super-I/O chip.

The VIA and nVidia machines do not have "LPC" in their bridge name, but
they do have a Super-I/O chip, while the first Intel machine doesn't.

As a conclusion, there is no clear relationship between the presence of
an ISA or LPC bridge and the presence of a Super-I/O chip. All we can
say is that apparently all PC systems have an ISA bridge. So indeed we
can probably make the probes conditional upon the presence of an "ISA
bridge" PCI device. That's very easy to test. In practice it might be
equivalent to making the driver x86-only.
