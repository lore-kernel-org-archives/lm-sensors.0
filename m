Makes sense. No strong opinion on my side, really. Using crit/lcrit is fine for me as well.
Maybe we should wait if there is input from others and go with lcrit if there is none.

On a side note, libsensors does not support inX_fault today, even though 
it is mentioned in the API, and there is no currX_fault. Likewise, libsensors supports 
currX_alarm but it is not mentioned in hwmon/sysfs-interface.
Unless there are objections, I'll clean that up when I add support for the _[l]crit objects.

Also, lib/sensors.conf.5 has a comment "Likewise, tempX_crit often comes with tempX_max_crit".
Since tempX_max_crit does not exist, it might make sense to remove that comment.
