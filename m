All I can see really is +1, sad to see you go and thanks for all the work done!

I too don't want to see any patches get dropped, so I'll try to step up a 
little with regards to reviewing hwmon patches, I would be grateful if you 
could incorporate any patches Acked by me in said tree. Esp since my git-fu 
isn't all that good.

Don't get me wrong either, I will try to step up my reviewing but I am _not_ 
volunteering to become the new hwmon subsystem maintainer either. I'm just 
starting a new job and with that combined with that I'm doing a lot of v4l work 
lately, I simply don't have the time for this.

+1
