Sorry, for any inconvenience, but you should forget about what 
I've written, that reverting the patch in question from 3.13.x 
didn't fix it. Of course it didn't fix it, as the patch doesn't 
cleanly revert from release-kernels at all. My mistake!

I' ve been guided by Guenter Roeck through two more bisecting 
sessions/ways on this, that always pointed to the commit in question.

Some citation:

That seems to be all I can do for you for now. Please let me know 
of any preliminary patches to test!
And I want to add special thanks to Guenter Roeck for his 
always-just-in-time assistance over so many days,

Manuel Krause
