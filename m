Excellent but quite different question. Quite frankly, I would love to be able
to use DT to describe a platform and its configuration and use instead of just
its hardware. Just like with thermal data, it would be great if I could use
devicetree information to describe limits for hwmon devices and configuration
information for all kinds of devices. This would simplify my life a lot.
Unfortunately, that is not how it works, so one ends up with pre-configuring
devices on ROMMON or secondary methods such as sensors.conf for hwmon devices.
Sure, that all works, but for embedded devices it means I have to re-build the
root file system each time a limit is changed. It _would_ be much simpler to
just be able to change the limit(s) in devicetree data and be done.

So, no, I don't have a good other solution. I have seen attempts to implement a
user-space 'parallel' devicetree, or the above mentioned sensors.conf file, but
nothing comprehensive. If you find a good generic solution, let me know.

Note that ACPI is an attempt to do that, but its scope is not limited to
describing the hardware, and it is not available on non-Intel embedded systems.
Also, it is typically controlled by another entity in a company (the BIOS
engineers), who tend to be highly resistive to changes. Modifying ACPI
data tends to be way more difficult than modifying devicetree data.

For device registration itself, definitely. An instance of a sensor driver
should not have to know how (or if) it is used by the system, just like a gpio
driver does not have to know if and how the gpio pins it provides are used.

Binding is the tricky question here, as it is all virtual and, as you said
yourself, describes the interaction and thus use of the various sensors and
cooling devices to accomplish the ultimate goal of keeping the system in an
acceptable temperature range. Hopefully you'll get an answer from the
devicetree experts if your intended devicetree usage of it is acceptable.
