Could you explain (just in a reply) what a cooling state is and what are
the min and max values used for?

What about replacing temperature and hysteresis with a single temperature
property that can be either one cell for 0 hysteresis or two cells to
specify lower and upper range of temperatures?

The two above seem to be implying action, as opposed to the general
comment about trip points.

I believe you don't need the min- and max-state properties here then. Your
thermal core can simply query the cpufreq driver (which would be a cooling
device here) about the range of states it supports.

This is similar. The fan driver will probaby know about available
fan speed levels and be able to report the range of states to thermal
core.

That's just for the binding. I will try to review the code when I find
a bit more time.

Best regards,
Tomasz
