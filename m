This doesn't make much sense. We call f71882fg_find up to twice, so we
can get up to 2 error codes, but the module init function can only
return one. There is no rationale for favoring the value returned by
the second call over the value returned by the first call. So it seems
reasonable to return an arbitrary error code. Of course we could spend
code comparing the error values and returning the right one if the two
functions returned the same error value, and only use the arbitrary
default if they returned different values. But honestly I don't see any
point in doing this in practice. Let's just log errors other than
-ENODEV so that the user can see the exact cause of failure in the
kernel log.

I disagree. If the probe of 0x2e/0x2f fails because that region was busy,
this should not prevent us from giving a try to region 0x4e/0x4f. I
can't think of any error that would warrant avoiding the probe at
0x4e/0x4f. Worse thing that can happen is that the second probe fails
too. No big deal.

I don't like either implementation, I would leave the code as it is
today.
