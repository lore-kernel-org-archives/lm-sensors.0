The "i2c-15" above suggests that you have at least 16 I2C adapters on
your system. There are many such adapters in graphics cards, TV cards
(both analog and digital) and on the mainboard as well. You can get a
list with:

# modprobe i2c-dev
# i2cdetect -l

But given the problem you've just reported, I expect the above command
to crash on 2.6.37-rc1. You could try it on 2.6.36 to at least give me a
rough idea of what I2C adapters are available on your system. This
would help me understand what's happening.

Do you have any DVB adapter in this machine?

OK. I'll try this config on my system and see if I can reproduce your
problem. Likely not before tomorrow though, as I have more urgent
issues to deal with right now.
