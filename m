Hello all,

Here is the continuation of work of representing hardware thermal properties
in device tree infrastructure. The present patch series is the fourth version
of this work. Previous versions were sent as RFCs and can be found here:
V3: 
RFCv2: http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/23/594
RFCv1: http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/22/319

Major difference from V3 is on the parser itself. I have updated the binding
documentation and improved the code accordingly to previous comments mainly
from Mark R. and Joe P.

The changes on hwmon drivers have been accepted by Guenter, and in this
series I am including his Acked-by, as I didn't change anything on that side.

I also found a bug while using all involved code built as modules, thus
I have reworked a bit the cooling device registration part. This is why
there are two new patches in this series (patches 02 and 04).

Tests were done, just like in V3, on TI OMAP4430, OMAP4460, OMAP5430 and DRA7,
although this series is not including the DRA7 part (I will be sending separately).

Thanks all who have been contributing reviewing this code.

All best,

Eduardo Valentin (18):
