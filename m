Thanks for rising your voice here. It is important to know what hwmon
ppl think about this.

As your answers to the series are giving same argument, I chose to
answer on patch 0. I would be happier if you could elaborate a bit more
on your concern, specially if you take hwmon cap here, and give your
view with that perspective.

I also considered that this work could be abusing of DT purposes. But
let me explain why I still think it makes sense to have it.

First thing is that this series intend to describe the thermal data
required for a specific board. That means, considering your board
layout, mechanics, power dissipation and composition of your ICs, etc,
that will impose thermal requirements on your system. That is not
configuration, but part of your board design and non-functional
requirement. To me, configuration would be something like saying you
want to use a specific keyboard layout, or defining your wifi card
channel, or display size, etc.

Here what is described and setup may get confused with configuration,
but it is not because what goes in DT in this case must be actually
derived from your HW needs. Putting a sensor  close to your battery has
a strong meaning behind. Same if you put a sensor close to your
processor. For instance, we have cases we need to consider external heat
in order to properly determine our CPU hotspot level, using a board
sensor. That is what I mean by HW requirement/need.

Again, just to refresh our minds, this is about protecting your board
and ICs from operating out of their spec and extending their lifetime.
This is not about configuring something just because user has chosen to.
That is definitely not a configuration.

Being a use case, well, these new DT nodes can still be seen as a use
case, yes. But depends on your understanding of use case. Because a
sensor device may be used on different needs, composing different use
cases. But still here we are talking about HW needs and composition. And
yes, if you take that perspective, there are use cases already described
in DT.

For instance, just because you use an LDO to power a MMC, does it mean
you always will use it to power MMC on all boards. Would that be a use
case? And in that example, because your MMC requires 2.8V, if you have a
DT property to say that, does it mean it is  configuration? Well, yes,
but that is based on HW needs, otherwise it wont operate properly. Same
thing here, leave your hw operating out of temperature specs and you
will see what is the outcome.

Similar example would be cpufreq, or OPPs for opp layer. Defining an OPP
in DT could be considered a configuration?  Well in theory yes, one can
pick what ever configuration for your (D)PLL then match with a
minimalist voltage level. And in theory, a voltage level can sustain
more than one frequency level. An OPP is still a virtual concept, and we
still describe it in DT. Why? To me is because it is a HW need, because
HW folks have actually validated that configuration of PLL (frequency)
and voltage level. Sometimes they have even optimized it (for low power
consumption for instance), as one may achieve same OPP with different
configuration. Then why thermal data, which is again, a 'HW
configuration' that has been optimized by HW folks, known to be a HW
requirement, cannot be described in DT?

Similar argument goes to the fact that one may think this is subsystem
specific. Again, describing your OPPs is not OPP layer specific?
Besides, one can still read the device tree nodes I have written for
describing thermal data and implement the HW requirement elsewhere, if
wanted (say in user land). I don't see as subsystem specific.

Keep in mind that these very same concepts are actually derived from
ACPI specification. They don't come from nowhere. And just because your
system does not have ACPI support, does not mean it won't have a need to
describe thermal?

So, because with this work (i) we are describing something that is
required for properly usage of your HW (and not choice of the user),
because (ii) same data is used on different specification (that is used
on different OSes too), because (iii) you don't need thermal fw to read
this data and you could implement the HW requirement elsewhere, because
(iv) there are other similar requirements already implemented via DT; I
still think this work is within DT scope. And that is based on evidence
of existing work not because DT is nice and I would want to use it.

Hope that clarifies.

Of course it is always welcome to hear ppl opinion. I would be really
interested to know what ppl from OF think about this topic.

If still, this does not fit DT, I would like to understand a proper
argument. Better than, this is configuration/use case.
