Hi Oliver,

You are writing to the wrong mailing list (i2c instead of lm-sensors)
so I am redirecting.

There is nothing wrong here. +3.26V sounds possible and correct for the
battery voltage. If you are worried about the min and max values: it is
up to you to edit your sensors3.conf file to set them properly if the
BIOS of your motherboard did not (apply the changes with "sensors -s").
The alarm will go away when you do.

Completely irrelevant here, the Winbond W83627THF is an LPC chip, it
doesn't have an I2C/SMBus interface, so the SMBus controller doesn't
matter at all.
