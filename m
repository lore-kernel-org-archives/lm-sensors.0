I see. I had stable kernel series in mind when you mentioned
backporting - obviously this was too restrictive and you have different
needs.

I didn't expect it to be difficult to limit the scope of a
cherry-picked patch to a single file. Is it?

I'm still using quilt so it means quite some manual work for me. Probably
I could automate part of it, and I would if it was happening
frequently. But as it stands it's rather rare.

Another point in favor of splitting, which I didn't mention earlier: it
makes the Cc list way shorter :)

OK. Well, only two of "my" drivers are affected by Joe's patch (it87
and pcf8591), so if you prefer the split variant, you could pick all
the individual patches except these two, and I take these two.

But first of all, I really would like the pr_fmt issue do be sorted
out. I don't like the idea of having to redefine it in every driver,
when it seems easy to avoid that. Joe?
