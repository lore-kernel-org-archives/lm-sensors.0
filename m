stupid gcc.

I wonder if we could do something along these lines:

static inline u8 __div_round_up_u8(u8 n, u8 d)
{
	...
}

static inline u16 __div_round_up_u16(u16 n, u16 d)
{
	...
}

<etc>

#define DIV_ROUND_UP(n, d)
	(sizeof(n) = 8 ? __div_round_up_u8(n, d) :
	    (sizeof(n) = 16 ? __div_round_up_u16(n, d) :
		(sizeof(n) = 32 ? __div_round_up_u32(n, d) :
		 	(sizeof(n) = 64 ? __div_round_up_u64(n, d) :
				__panic_i_am_confused()))))

which might work but is arguably too stupid to live.  And whcih still cannot
be used for compile-time array-sizing.
