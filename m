I am confused. According to my notes, the MAX6648/MAX6692 is the same
chip as the MAX6646/MAX6647/MAX6649 (same chip ID of 0x59), the only
difference being the I2C address (0x4c for the MAX6646, 0x4e for the
MAX6647 and 0x4d for the MAX6648/MAX6649/MAX6692). So the current code
should _already_ detect your MAX6648 or MAX6692 as kind = max6646.

Can you please test the latest version of the sensors-detect script [1]
and let me know if your chip is properly detected? If not, please
provide a dump of your chip.
