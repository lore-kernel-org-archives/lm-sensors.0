It's different from the millidegree/millivolt issue; millivolts can be
transparently converted by libsensors, while relative values must be
handled/displayed differently by the application.  So I think at least
in the libsensors API, relative values should be different.

(In any case, we should add temp#_scale at least for millivolts.)

The sysfs interface is a somewhat internal interface; I think the main
question is whether old userspace (old libsensors or old apps using a
new libsensors) should be able to see relative values without knowing
that they are relative.

Coretemp and k10temp already exist and show relative values.  If we
introduced a new channel for relative values now, we would still have
problems with those drivers, so it might already be too late to avoid
problems for old userspace.


Best regards,
Clemens
