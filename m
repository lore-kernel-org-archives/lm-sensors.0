Hi Mark

Thanks for another good review round. I am following up your concerns

Well, no. The note was more to say we still don't have a final
agreement. But for merging this patch, once we have agreed to get it
merged, I believe this comment can be left out.

Do you mean we should remove one \t? While in patch format it looks odd,
but in the ending file it will be aligned to the above descriptions
(from hysteresis and temperature).

OK. It would be nice to have a suggestion of preferred spacing though.

OK. So specifier is the set of values that describe the reference to a
phandle. I will rephrase the document accordingly.

The code define is -1UL (pasting existing defines):
/* invalid cooling state */
#define THERMAL_CSTATE_INVALID -1UL

/* No upper/lower limit requirement */
#define THERMAL_NO_LIMIT	THERMAL_CSTATE_INVALID

While polling for this zone, in any other state other than when doing
passive cooling, the above polling value is used. Including for when
doing any other cooling whatsoever.

The reason is to describe where (physically) the sensor is, or which
location it represents, when a thermal zone is composed by several sensor=
s.

I see. So, answering you question in [1], I believe comments are enough
to describe where each sensor is located, if needed while writing the
binding for a specific thermal zone. At runtime, what would really make
the difference is the usage of the 'coefficients' property below, as
there is no simple way to guess the sensor contribution in the linear
relation just based on the string names provided.  Unless there is a
need to have this information, just for hardware description purposes.

No, that was a very mistake in my phrasing. The above sentence must be:

OK. They are indexes of OPPs, yes, but in reverse order. That is, in the
case the CPU has 4 OPPs, 0 means all for OPPs are allowed to be used, 1
means only 3 lower OPPs are allowed, 2 means only 2 lower OPPs are
allowed to be used and 1 means only the lowest is allowed. I will add a
more detailed example.
