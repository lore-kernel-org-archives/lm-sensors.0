I'm happy with having these as separate properties.

The set of names can be extended in future, and we can choose to have an
attention-level property in future, and map the existing types to them.
If we don't have something fundamantally better, I think this should be
OK for now.

This is arguable. The {min,max} levels associated with a cooling state
is essentially a recommendation of a sane set of values you might want
to use the cooling device with.

It could work using only the cooling device's information, but it might
not be all that useful. The range might not represent a linear scale,
and there might be secondary effects to consider (e.g. noise) that would
affect the decision and would likely need to be considered by the
particular drivers.

The key question is where do we make the trade off? How much platform
knowledge do we want each driver to have to handle, and how much are we
happy to place in DT?

It is possible to use the information from particular devices and ignore
the {min,max} cooling state properties in future if that turns out to be
better. I think that would be reasonable for now.

Thanks,
Mark.
