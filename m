The LTC2978 spec says that the OPERATION command register "responds to
the global page command (PAGE=0xFF)."  I originally took it to mean
that it *only* responds to 0xFF.  Now I get that yes I could turn
on/off each of 8 channels separately.

I will make the change have one regulator for each supply.  It would
be useful to still have a global regulator for turning them all on/off
together if that is not completely odious.

For all the parts supported by ltc2978.c, a banked write of 0x80 to
the OPERATION register turns a regulator on, writing 0x00 turns it
off.  I'm not sure how universal that is for other PMBUS parts.  I
will look at the PMBUS specs when I get back to the office Tuesday.

I'll look into it and see if I can push almost all of this code into
pmbus_core.c and just have per-chip config values in
pmbus_driver_info.   If many PMBUS parts have the same scheme (0x80 or
0x00 written to OPERATION register as a banked write) then  a flag bit
that is turned on in pmbus_driver_info could enable this scheme for
this chip.  If it is a different register or different on/off values,
then I'll need to add those to pmbus_driver_info.

OK.  Will add pmbus_write_byte_data as a separate patch and use the
existing pmbus_read_byte_data.

Thanks for the review!
