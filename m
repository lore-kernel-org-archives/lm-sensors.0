It's over 6 month since I promised Samuel to rework the
not-really-MFD driver for Versatile Express sysregs. It's
also a while since I sent the RFC for the series, but
finally - it is here!

As suggested by Arnd back then, the VE configuration
infrastructure is now exposing standard regmap interface
instead of a custom one. As requested by Samuel, the sysreg
driver mainly consists of MFD cells definition now.

All this was possible thanks to the first patch, which
tries to address in a simple way an issue discussed
a number of times - a problem of early devices registration
in a "DT-powered" system. It simply makes it possible
to manually create devices for selected nodes at appropriate
init levels and guarantees that such devices will not
be created again during the massive of_platform_populate().

I think it would make sense to merge the whole series
through arm-soc tree so will appreciate opinions and/or
acks from respective maintainers.
