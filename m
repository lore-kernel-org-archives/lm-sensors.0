The datasheet isn't the best quality I've seen. The gain values
mentioned to not even match the formulas in the same cell... But I can't
object to implementing conversions the way the datasheet says, no
matter how suspicious.

I don't really know what tree the patch is based on. Anthony said
linux-next but I can't see ichg_reg_to_mA there.

If volt_reg_to_mv is updated then you certainly want to update
vbbat_reg_to_mv the same way, as it diverges from the datasheet just
the same.

Also, please update Documentation/hwmon/da9052 so that the
documentation matches the actual driver code.

I really would like to hear what David Dajun Chen has to say about
that. He must have had a reason to use different conversions formulas
than the datasheet specifies.
