Hmm, I thought so for a while as well. Now I'm not that sure any
longer...

Sorry, no. I actually don't even have Windows on this machine at
all... I suppose I could add another drive to the system and install
Windows just for this purpose, but that it quite the task to I'd
rather avoid it unless you know this will tell us something that is
impossible to get some other way...

Sure, that's a lot easier...

This program will help you determine which I2C/SMBus modules you need to
load to use lm_sensors most effectively. You need to have i2c and
lm_sensors installed before running this program.
Also, you need to be `root', or at least have access to the /dev/i2c-*
files, for most things.
If you have patched your kernel and have some drivers built in, you can
safely answer NO if asked to load some modules. In this case, things may
seem a bit confusing, but they will still work.

It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all
questions, unless you know what you're doing.

 We can start with probing for (PCI) I2C or SMBus adapters.
 You do not need any special privileges for this.
 Do you want to probe now? (YES/no):
Probing for PCI bus adapters...
Use driver `i2c-i801' for device 00:1f.3: Intel ICH7
Probe succesfully concluded.

We will now try to load each adapter module in turn.
Module `i2c-i801' already loaded.
If you have undetectable or unsupported adapters, you can have them
scanned by manually loading the modules before running this script.

 To continue, we need module `i2c-dev' to be loaded.
 If it is built-in into your kernel, you can safely skip this.
i2c-dev is already loaded.

 We are now going to do the adapter probings. Some adapters may hang halfway
 through; we can't really help that. Also, some chips will be double detected;
 we choose the one with the highest confidence value in that case.
 If you found that the adapter hung after probing a certain address, you can
 specify that address to remain unprobed. That often
 includes address 0x69 (clock chip).

Next adapter: SMBus I801 adapter at 3080

Some chips are also accessible through the ISA bus. ISA probes are
typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
this. This is usually safe though.

 I will now generate the commands needed to load the I2C modules.
 Sometimes, a chip is available both through the ISA bus and an I2C bus.
 ISA bus access is faster, but you need to load an additional driver module
 for it. If you have the choice, do you want to use the ISA bus or the
 I2C/SMBus (ISA/smbus)?

To make the sensors modules behave correctly, add these lines to
/etc/modules.conf:

#----cut here----
# I2C module options
alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
#----cut here----

To load everything that is needed, add this to some /etc/rc* file:

#----cut here----
# I2C adapter drivers
modprobe i2c-i801
modprobe i2c-isa
# I2C chip drivers
modprobe w83792d
modprobe eeprom
# Warning: the required module smbus-arp is not currently installed on your system.
# For status of 2.6 kernel ports see http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/supported.html
# If driver is built-in to the kernel, or unavailable, comment out the following line.
modprobe smbus-arp
modprobe it87
# sleep 2 # optional
/usr/local/bin/sensors -s # recommended
#----cut here----

WARNING! If you have some things built into your kernel, the list above
will contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones! You really should
try these commands right now to make sure everything is working properly.
Monitoring programs won't work until it's done.

Do you want to generate /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors? (yes/NO):


> Also can you confirm if you have onboard the PC87431 chip?

I've been looking, but I can't find such a chip... I actually don't
think that this mini BMC think is more then a software feature of the
BIOS that can read the sensor limits. But then again I may be wrong...

Here's a pointer to the manual:

http://us.giga-byte.com/Download/Download.asp?DownloadPath=/Server/FileList/Manual/4mxsv_1001.pdf

This is from the manual:

Hardware Monitor 

*Winbond 83792D controller

*Enhanced features with CPU Vcore, 1.5V reference, VCC3 (3.3V),
 VCC5V, +12V, 2.5V,VBAT3V, +5V SB, CPU Temperature, and
 System Temperature Values viewing by

*Support basic ASF remote transaction through CSA Bus with hardware
 circuit

BIOS 

*Phoenix BIOS on 8Mb flash RAM

*Software mini BMC

Note that second bullet under Hardware Monitor actually ends in
"by"... I don't know what this CSA bus thing is though?

I received an answer from Gigabyte, they told me to refer to the
system block diagram in the manual for the W83792D chip is connected
in my system. Well that's not very useful since the W82792D isn't even
on the system block diagram...

Thanks
