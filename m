Oh, that's nice to hear that NCTs are compatible! I'll see that can I do
about additional caseopen on NCT6776F.

Considering second caseopen on NCT6776F that sounds sensible.

Ugh. These are remnants from my debugging printouts - I removed
printouts, but forgot to drop register readings as well. They are surely
not needed.

Yes. And this "12" shouldn't be here as well (though it doesn't really
matter, as it's not used by show_caseopen/store_caseopen_clear) - it was
the number of caseopen bit in alarm registers, when I was trying to use
show_alarm() for reading caseopen status. Sadly that never worked for
me, as in spite that datasheets told, this bit contained realtime state
of caseopen pin without any latch! - i.e. it was 0 when caseopen was
triggered and 1, when it wasn't. And once "case was closed" it again
became 1.

Thanks for review! I'll try to send updated patch shortly.
