One option would be to switch to SENSOR_ATTR_2 and use the second
parameter as an index into the reg array, which in turn could become a
2-D array (or 1-D array of pair structs). I wasn't a big fan of
SENSOR_ATTR_2 originally because its attribute are small (u8) and
easily confused (index vs. nr) but it has its technical merits. Maybe
someday we'll unify SENSOR_ATTR and SENSOR_ATTR_2 into a single
structure with reasonably sized and named attributes. That will be a
lot of work though.

Of course it is.

It's not that bad. A constant, non-00, non-ff device ID, even
non-documented, has some value.

Oh right. Same device ID, of course :(

I don't. But I can try obtaining the information for you, stay tuned.

Yes, delaying register reads until they are really needed is good
practice.

Yes, a separate patch would be good.
