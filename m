Yeah, I followed the default assumption. It does not hurt to be

Those are example of cooling devices, yes. But in this context what is
interesting is those devices that allow you to control the amount of
dissipated power, i.e. operating frequency/voltage, lcd brightness,
audio volume, radio transmission power, or if those that you burn power
by turning them on but you remove heat out of your thermal zone, like a
speed controllable fan.

I got confused now. How adding a monitored-zones property on sensor's
nodes would imply that device's output is to be consumed on the binding
for the device itself?

It is possible yes, by means of a couple of complex differential
equations implementation.  But still, determining the maximum dT/dt may
require unnecessary polling on low activity use cases. Besides, people
who do transient thermal simulation should have a better estimate on
necessary polling requirement. I don't see why we should not use that
handy info and impose hard software requirements.

You mean, thermal zones must have address and size cells to describe trip=

But it does not need to be active all the time. You need to say when (in
temperature domain) that is need. Besides, there are even other means of
managing average power other than cpufreq cooling. idle injections is
another passive cooling device, for instance.

Do you mean some sort of list of trip points property inside binding

Are you suggesting having inside thermal zone node:

Where sensor0 and sensorN are sensor IPs nodes and Y and Z represent

Ahh.. OK. I just didnt want o let the memory be managed and freed only
when the struct device is release.

Because you may assign cooling state limits to specific trip points,
e.g., a fan with 5 different speeds would operate from speed 0 to 2 in
the first trip point, while from speed 3 to 4 on last trip point.
