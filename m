Couple of problems I noticed when browsing through the code.

- Some functions return errors with return code 0.

	if (ret <= 0)
		goto out;
	...
out:
	return ret;

  For values of 0, the calling code will likely miss the error.

- In some cases, returned errors are replaced with another error

	if (ret < 0)
		return -EIO;

  You should return the original error.

- Try using something better than -EIO is possible. For example, you can use
  -EINVAL for invalid parameters.

- Don't use strict_str functions. Use kstr functions instead (checkpatch should
  tell you that, actually).

- Try using dev_ messages as much as possible (instead of pr_)

- Try allocating memory with devm_ functions. This way you can drop the matching
  calls to kfree().

- I notice you use kmalloc() a lot. That is ok if you know that you'll
  initialize all fields, but it is kind of risky. Better use kzalloc().
  (if you start using devm_kzalloc, the issue becomes mostly irrelevant,
  as there is no devm_kmalloc).

For my part I like the architecture of your driver. Wonder how difficult
it would be to implement the functionality supported by the in-kernel driver
(eg watchdog) with your infrastructure.

Overall it would be great if you and Tomas could get together and come up
with a unified implementation.

Thanks,
Guenter
