Family? The driver only supports one chip.

This is very weird. This pretty much voids the point of an automatic
fan control mode. If you have to read registers continuously for it to
work, you can as well control it completely in software.

Actually every 5 seconds according to the driver code.

This "therefore" is incorrect. You can't deduce the physical resolution
from the ADC resolution, you need to additionally know the LSB weight
for that.

Please send an updated patch.

Out of curiosity: isn't it possible to detect how many thermal sensors
are actually connected, and only create sysfs files for these? Creating
files for sensors which do not exist is rather confusing.
