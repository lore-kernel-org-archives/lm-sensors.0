Jean will have to ack it.

Even then it would be unreasonable to enforce such a delay for every instance
of this driver, even if the regulator is a dummy one and/or has been enabled
already. Many if not almost all users of the driver work just fine as-is,
without additional enforced delay (and, for that matter, without regulator ;).

If there is a delay, it would have to be optional: Only wait if the regulator
was really turned on by the call and not already active. I don't know if the
regulator subsystem has this capability; if not, maybe it should.

On a higher level, I wonder if such functionality should be added in the i2c
subsystem and not in i2c client drivers. Has anyone thought about this ?
