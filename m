I think if we're trying to make something that will cover a number
of device classes, we need to be more like HID and have a system
that reports and possibly records the following:

1) What data is possible to be returned from each event, with the
   units, magnitude and any scale applied by the device sending.

2) Each event should be able to report a number of items, so that
   if the sensor reports X/Y/Z in one go, there is just a single
   event containing those values.

3) A well defined set of information that can be read (like #1)
   that can provide details of the device and how it relates to
   the environment it is in.
