Have you tried the patch set from Javi? the power allocator schem 
includes a PID controller governor. Might be worth having a common
solution. I think it is easier if I merge his changes into a branch and
you have try on it. His patch series have already gone through several
reviews. But you are free to comment too.

I am afraid moving the maps and trips properties to optional abuses the
purpose of the thermal DT. The primary goal is to describe hardware, and
in this specific case, the hardware proper thermal operating conditions.

DT has to be as agnostic to OS implementation as possible.

For the above reason, I do not think this patch is a good idea.
