No problem. I appreciate your time.

Did that already after the comment in the earlier patch of the series.

I moved lm90_select_remote_channel() so the lm90_read_reg() declaration
is no longer needed.

Code structure is such that sensor show/set functions come first, followed by
"real" code. Unfortunately, that implies that local functions called from
those functions have to be forward declarated.

We can move that around to avoid forward declarations, but I would prefer
to do that in a separate patch if we decide to go that way.

I am impressed. Good catch.

Makes sense. That will be in patch #6 (previously patch #5), though,
with additional code here, and yet another attribute in the ABI.
