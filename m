Why? What is the gain?

Perf events can be triggered at any point in the kernel.
A cpufreq event is triggered when the frequency gets changed.
CPU idle events are triggered when the kernel requests to enter an idle state
or exits one.

When would you trigger a thermal or a power event?
There is the possibility of (critical) thermal limits.
But if I understand this correctly you want this for debugging and
I guess you have everything interesting one can do with temperature
values:
  - read the temperature
  - draw some nice graphs from the results

Hm, I guess I know what you want to do:
In your temperature/energy graph, you want to have some dots
when relevant HW states (frequency, sleep states,  DDR power,...)
changed. Then you are able to see the effects over a timeline.

So you have to bring the existing frequency/idle perf events together
with temperature readings

Cleanest solution could be to enhance the exisiting userspace apps
(pytimechart/perf timechart) and let them add another line
(temperature/energy), but the data would not come from perf, but
from sysfs/hwmon.
Not sure whether this works out with the timechart tools.
Anyway, this sounds like a userspace only problem.
