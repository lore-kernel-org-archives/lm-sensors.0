Code such as

	if (ret <= 0) {
		pr_err(...);
		goto out;
	}

does look like an error, though. If it isn't, there should be no error message.

And if it is a function such as qst_get_mon_config(), which ends up printing
the content of the non-retrieved message, it most definitely looks wrong.

The same really applies to each case I have noticed.

Other drivers doing the same bad thing doesn't mean you should do it as well :).

Just think about the best error to use. For example, you use -EINVAL if
wait_event_interruptible_timeout times out. That should really, at least most
likely, be -ETIMEDOUT. Actually those calls are problematic anyway, as they 
are interruptable and might leave the mei device in an undefined state.
Can that happen ?

Ok, makes sense.

Hmm .. usually one initializes the structure to zero to avoid unpredictable
behavior. The argument for zeroing out a data structure is pretty much the
same as yours for not zeroing it out.

With your approach you hope to get either a compiler error or some
unpredictable behavior / crash if you forget to initialize an element.
I don't think that is such a good idea.

The kernel community in general prefers an incremental approach, where an
existing driver is not replaced but continually improved. I don't know what the
best approach is here, but you'll need to find a way to introduce your code
in a non-disruptive way.

Couple of additional comments.

return; at the end of a void function is really not necessary.

There are several functions which can get an error from underlying code, display
an error to the log, yet return void. Maybe there is a good reason for that, but
it would be better to pass errors to calling code whenever possible.

In some cases, such as mei_attach_client(), it definitely looks wrong that
errors are just ignored - especially since the calling code does have a return
value.

It is also a bit odd that functions like handle_ver_rsp() report an error to
the log, yet return no indication to the caller about it. Anything resulting
in a pr_err log message should really be reported to the caller, or it is not
an error.

Thanks,
Guenter
