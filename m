Do I/O regions count as "global objects"?

Basically an SMBus transaction looks like this:
1* Prepare the transaction.
2* Start the transaction.
3* Wait for the transaction to complete, typically a few ms.
4* Read the result of the transaction.

Steps 1 and 2 require writing to the SMBus I/O region. Step 4 requires
reading from it, and so does step 3 if the wait loop is poll-based. The
transaction is only safe if we have an exclusive access to the I/O
region during all the 4 steps. My fear is that step 3 could be
implemented by ACPI using either a Sleep() or Acquire() or Wait()
opcode. If it is, we're doomed. OTOH, if it does, it is probably not
even safe for itself, unless there's an additional,
implementation-specific mutex to protect SMBus transactions. I yet have
to get my hands on the DSDT of ACPI implementations which actually
access the SMBus to see exactly how they do it.

Could regular Linux device drivers install such handlers for a specific
I/O region? I'm asking because Rudolf Marek's proposal [1] to solve the
concurrent access problem involved extending struct resource with
callbacks to driver-specific routines to handle external access to an
I/O region. This sounds somewhat similar to these "user-installed
operation region handler" defined by ACPI, doesn't it? If ACPI already
has an infrastructure to handle this problem, we probably want to use
it rather than implementing our own.
