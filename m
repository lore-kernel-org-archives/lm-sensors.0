The main reason for using atk0110 is correctness: the resources are
claimed by ACPI, it might not be safe to touch them (for the same
reason two drivers are not allowed to map e.g. the same PCI BAR).
On newer boards the risk of collision is pretty high, since the hwmon
chip is used by an EC that works in background... on other boards the
risk is much lower since the hwmon chip doesn't seem to be probed
actively.
Anyway, as user you can override this decision with
"acpi_enforce_resources=lax", but _I_ wouldn't recommend it.
