I think the point Pawel was getting at is that the string doesn't have a
*well-defined* meaning that always allows an OS to figure out the set of
relevant devices. If we have a thermal zone for "LCD", and have multiple
LCDs, which LCDs are covered? If we have a "PCB" zone, does this cover all
the devices attached to the PCB, a subset thereof, or the substrate of
the PCB itself?

A phandle list to the concerned devices for example would *always* allow
the OS to figure out the set of concerned devices.

For the CPU case at least, if we have a thermal zone with an attached
sensor and no real thermal device, I don't think it's too much of a
stretch for the OS to figure out that the only thing it can do is some
cpufreq-like scaling and limiting to attempt to keep below the limits.

I don't think we need to describe the cpu as a cooling device for a cpu,
and I certainly don't think we need to describe a particular mechanism
by which the thermal limits should be maintained (though when we have a
fan, or other active cooling device, describing to the OS that this may
be used is sensible).

This sounds like the case we have with OPPs in that the information
required to figure out the valid points at which an OS can drive the
hardware is driven by rather complex interactions between various
components, and it's not clear whether describing all that information
is worthwhile. That said, I'm not sure what my opinion on the matter is.

Sounds like we agree there :)

Thanks,
