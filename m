I think that's a valid point. I am willing to keep it small, but I
would prefer to follow the pattern set in other subsystems. It may be
my lack of experience in designing a subsystem showing here! What are
some alternative ways to implement it?

In other words, Jim's patches are a good start, but maybe I am
misunderstanding them. I see it as the superio-locks module, a driver
that other drivers would depend on / auto-load. Is that something
other subsystems also do?

Regards,
David
