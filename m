Hi Wei,

Sorry for the late reply.

OK, this is what the chip is designed for, good.

Why don't you use the SMBus alert mechanism then? It is already
implemented and allows you to reuse the interrupt of the SMBus
controller.

Of course this is a question for the hardware designers, not you... If
the board uses a separate interrupt pin for the NCT1008's ALERT output,
then the driver has to handle that interrupt explicitly, as done in your
patch.

One thing which worries me though is this explanation in the NCT1008
datasheet:

"The ALERT interrupt latch is not reset by reading the
status register. It resets when the ALERT output has been
serviced by the master reading the device address, provided
the error condition has gone away and the status register flag
bits are reset."

This suggests that connecting the ALERT output to a separate interrupt
pin will not work, as the ALERT output will never be de-asserted even
if the fault conditions are gone and the status register was read. But
as you say this is how your system is supposed to work, can you explain
how it can work?

Hu ho, I have seen this kind of design in the past, and I must say I
don't quite like it. Moving critical thermal management handling to the
software makes me feel unsafe. System thermal safety should not rely on
the OS IMHO. It is best handled by the hardware, or if that can't be
done, by the BIOS. And these limit updates are tricky, they could fail
and then you're in trouble. Imagine for example that another chip on
the SMBus hugs the bus and delays or even plain prevents the change of
limits...

But once again I guess you're not responsible for this.

Another problem with this design, even if no such problem happens, is
that the limits are user(-space)-writable in the lm90 driver, while
with your design these limits are under full control of the platform
management code. You definitely don't want the user to come and adjust
the limits, this could result in overheating of the system. So, do you
have a plan to optionally switch limits to read only in the lm90
driver? If not, how do you intend to solve the problem?

The more I think about it, the more I wonder if a custom thermal driver
wouldn't be better for your case. Exposing a few read-only values to
user-space through the thermal/hwmon bridge would IMHO make more sense
than cluttering the lm90 driver with conditionals to limit what it
exposes to user-space.

Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy with your efforts to upstream your
code, this is very welcome. And I am also very happy that you split it
into small chunks which are easier to review. But I also need to know
the big picture to see where you're ultimately going.

I'm curious how the nct1008 driver "handles these interrupts." IMHO
only the platform code knows what needs to be done upon reception of an
interrupt, in particular in your case where you'll do some magic with the
limit registers. There's no way this can be hard-coded in a hwmon
driver, lm90 or any other.
