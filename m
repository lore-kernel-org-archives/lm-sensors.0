We have I2C and SPI drivers so I assume you will use the lower layers of
the stacks to do this ?

I don't see much there which says why you can't unify all this in a user
space library.

For RS232/423/.. devices you can go this path if you want (but I would
keep it all in userspace anyway) as you can use a line discipline to sit
on top of the port and provide another interface (eg the way PPP does)
