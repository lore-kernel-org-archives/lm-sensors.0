On the plus side, though, a transient failure only causes a single read
operation to fail, since I don't update the timestamp nor the valid flag
in the error case. As a result, the next read will again try to update
all values. So it isn't really that bad. Only real drawback of my approach
is that a transient read failure on one sensor register will likely be
reported while trying to read data for another sensor.

Of course, you are right that a permanent error on a single register will
cause all sensor read operations to fail, which isn't really desirable.
I have no idea if that can happen in the real world, though. Seems to be
unlikely that a failing sensor would cause an I2C operation failure.
But who knows - maybe it does happen with some chips.

Basic reason for returning errors in the first place was that I was asked
to do so in review feedback for one of my drivers - specifically, that I
should not drop errors. So we would need some clear(er) guidelines
for new drivers if we want to go along that path.

Seems to be a bit excessive, and it doesn't seem to be worth the effort
and added complexity.

Still doesn't solve the permanent error case, though. Question remains, then,
if it is likely that a single i2c register would return a permanent error
while others still work.

I'll take that as a hint and won't make any changes to lm90 driver error 
handling.
