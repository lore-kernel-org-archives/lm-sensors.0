Doh. I've been looking at this for an hour and managed to miss
that :( Thanks for explaining.

I suppose this works, however I believe there is value in allowing for
modular building of as much code as possible.

I have an alternative proposal, which lets thermal be built as module,
and hopefully also addresses the issue (I can't test...) The only
drawback is that the same dependency must be added for every other
hwmon driver which optionally uses THERMAL_OF.

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>

Based on an earlier attempt by Randy Dunlap.

Fix SENSORS_LM75 dependencies to eliminate build errors:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `lm75_remove':
lm75.c:(.text+0x12bd8c): undefined reference to `thermal_zone_of_sensor_unregister'
drivers/built-in.o: In function `lm75_probe':
lm75.c:(.text+0x12c123): undefined reference to `thermal_zone_of_sensor_register'

Add depends on THERMAL since that is what provides the
register/unregister functions above, but only if THERMAL_OF was
selected as this is an optional feature of the driver.
