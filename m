OK. So you have a cooling device and it can have multiple cooling states,
like a cooling fan that has multiple speed levels. Did I understand this
correctly?

IMHO this should be also explained in the documentation above, possibly
with one or two examples.

Ranges is the representation widely used in other bindings. In addition
I believe a range is more representative - when reading a DTS you don't
need to think whether the hysteresis is in temperature units, percents or
something else and also is less ambiguous, because you have clearly
defined lower and upper bounds in one place.

For me "A trip point to enable active cooling" means that when this trip
point is crossed, active cooling must be enabled. What is it if not
implying action?

I didn't say anything about making the binding aware of cpufreq, but
instead about getting rid of redundancy of data, that can be provided
by respective drivers anyway.

I don't think you got my point correctly.

Let's say you have a CPU, which has 4 operating points. You don't need
to specify that min state is 0 and max state is 4, because it is implied
by the list of operating points.

Same goes for a fan controller that has, let's say, an 8-bit PWM duty
cycle register, which in turn allows 256 different speed states. This
implies that min state for it is 0 and max state 255 and you don't need
to specify this in DT.

Now, both a CPU and fan controller will have their thermal drivers, which
can report to the thermal core what ranges of cooling states they support,
which again makes it wrong to specify such data in DT.

Best regards,
Tomasz
