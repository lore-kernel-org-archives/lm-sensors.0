Mostly per register, but also per chip (for manufacturing specific registers
the register size is determined by the chip type). Also, there are block
registers. Plus, the scope of each register (ie if it is paged or not)
is chip specific.  The same register may be paged on one chip, and unpaged
on another. I'll have another look to see if that all can be mapped into the
regmap model. If yes, it might actually be quite helpful and might simplify
the pmbus code quite a bit.

Either case, even if regmap now supports all the PMBus oddities, converting
the pmbus drivers to use regmap should be a separate patch set and not be
tied together.

Tnanks,
