Yes, would be much better. Or you can make things even better by
defining arrays of variables in your data structure, and arrays for
register numbers too. And if you need to pass 2 identifiers per entry,
you can take a look at struct sensor_device_attribute_2. So you have a
lot of possibilities to make the code more compact. To which degree you
want that, is up to you.

Historical, as I recall, the strict variant did not exist when we
converted the first driver. And then copy-and-paste from driver to
driver, and here we are.
