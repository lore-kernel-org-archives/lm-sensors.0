No! Reporting broken monitoring values is worse than not returning any
value at all. The coretemp (and k8/k10temp) driver(s) already have a
very bad reputation for presenting relative temperature readings as
absolute ones, please let's not add to it.

At this point there are 2 things which can be done:
* If building a kernel for the Atom platform without PCI support is
  something relatively common, which makes sense, then we should look
  for an alternative way to determine the TjMax value for these CPUs,
  which doesn't require PCI support.
* If building a kernel for the Atom platform without PCI support is
  something rare, which makes little sense, then we can simply either
  prevent the driver from building at all in this case, or have it
  print a big fat warning (with suggestion to rebuild the kernel with
  PCI support) when it can't determine the TjMax value.

Do you mean it is strange from a technical perspective, or do you have
evidences that it doesn't work properly? This trick come from Intel
themselves, I would guess they know their business.

Higher or lower doesn't make a difference. As long as the coretemp
driver doesn't properly report the temperature values as being
relative, users don't expect the value to change depending on the
kernel version or configuration options. We have had dozens of user
reports because of this.
