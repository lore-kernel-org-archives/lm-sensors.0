Hello all,

Here is v5 of the work of representing hardware thermal properties
in device tree infrastructure. Previous versions can be
found here:
V4: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/26/787
V3: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/15/122
RFCv2: http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/23/594
RFCv1: http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/22/319

The differences from V4 of this series are pretty minor. Here is a shortlog:
1. Rephrased couple of sentences and improved description of a couple of properties.
2. Removed the macro constants for trip type from the binding header file.
3. Due to (3), patches 09/14/15 were adapted to use plain string constants
4. As per suggestion by Nishanth M. I also included in this series two
patches to move TI bandgap nodes to belong under OCP.
5. I volunteered to maintain the thermal binding, so added that to MAINTAINERS.

This specific series has been tested on OMAP4430, OMAP4460, OMAP5432 and DRA7.

All best,
