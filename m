MFD != gpio subsystem, but for some reason or another you continuously
overlook that. You also disregard what Markus wrote: this change is
just following the existing convention in there. Basically, your
suggestion would lead to a mixed interface where some feature of the
chip is exposed in 3-4 other places, and some centrally and in a
compact manner in hwmon.

That is clearly incorrect. To write a proper userspace middleware
would imply fishing stuff from several subspaces rather than using the
same compact interface. I called that a nightmare from end user point
of view.

I consider it worse than nitpicking eventually: imho, it is rejecting
a validated feature without providing a better change. It is a shame,
but we cannot do anything more at this point to provide remedy here
without getting financial loss, further time spent on a full rewrite,
and relevant study, etc. The kernel will remain without this feature
probably. I see it as a loss/loss for both parties. You will save
maintaining it (even though it is me who would probably need to
maintain this feature for the next few years...) for the cost of not
having the feature at all, most likely.

Well, I guess we will need to stick to a more feature-rich forked
version for us then.
