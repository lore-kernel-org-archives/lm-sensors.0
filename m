DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(0,-2)=1

This also happens if I keep the sneaky code. The v3 code does not have this
problem. I know it is a bit theoretic, but still there. Of course, I could
simply ignore the divisor's sign entirely, assuming (and documenting) that
negative divisors are just too odd to deal with. Commentss welcome ...

Ok.
