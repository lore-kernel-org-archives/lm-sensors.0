The patch looks good to me, will apply it after it has been verified to fix the problem.
BTW, I've been thinking of make CONFIG_THERMAL a bool since long time ago, the only thing that blocks me is that Thermal subsystem needs to register a hwmon device for each thermal zone and CONFIG_HWMON is a tristate.
