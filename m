Let's take the value from the register.

Not that stupid. Without programming the calibration register, the chip
will not report power and current. Expecting user space to "fix" the
situation if that happens seems to be at least as stupid as doing it in
the kernel (and, for example, the 'sensors' command won't be able to fix
it, nor any other program not running as root).

So it might make sense to move the chip initialization into an _init function,
call it from _probe, and call it from _update if, as you say, the calibration
register returns 0. The init function should initialize both the configuration
register and the calibration register. Make sure you update
data->reg[INA2XX_CALIBRATION] when you do that. In the latter case (update
function detects that chip is not initialized), you might also want to add
a dev_warn() as this is an unexpected situation.

Thanks,
Guenter
