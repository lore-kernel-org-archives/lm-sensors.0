No, I never said that. I wanted you to register the gpio pins
with the gpio subsystem. I didn't ask you to write a separate
driver for it.

Sure, strictly speaking one could write a top level mfd driver
and separate gpio and hwmon drivers, but at least in my opinion
that would be overkill. I also never suggested this; you brought
the term mfd into the discussion.
