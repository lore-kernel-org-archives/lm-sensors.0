Hi, Rene and Hans,

Thank you for your efforts on this issue and sorry for the late
response, I did not check my email during the whole weekend.

About the hwmon ABI, after the device symbol link is created, are there
any other ABIs required in the device node? 
If no, this patch seems to work, although it might break if the first
registered ACPI thermal zone device is unregistered, which ONLY happens
theoretically.

thanks,
rui
