I don't see any issue here, but anyway it doesn't really matter as the
proposed patch is not sufficient for all affected motherboards.

The real cause is pretty clear here: broken BIOS. In an ideal world we
would ask the manufacturer for a fixed BIOS and they would give that to
us, unfortunately my experience is that it won't happen. So, unless we
accept that idea that some users won't be able to use some of their
devices because of broken resource enumeration in their BIOS, we will
have to find a workaround, whatever it is.

My initial idea was to identify the faulty motherboard using DMI and to
force pnpacpi=off on the faulty motherboards. If this is considered too
aggressive, maybe we can just reject resource declarations that
intersect (but don't match) 0x290-0x297 for these motherboards. Either
way, we have to do something, and we have to do it quickly. 2.6.24
final isn't too far away, and more importantly, the patch that revealed
the problem has been backported to 2.6.23.10 so people are experiencing
regressions already.
