If there's a choice between "does not work but correct" and
"incorrect but works", i'd prefer the latter, and I'd say any
sane person agrees.

I spent quite some time choosing a motherboard that is able
to control fan speeds.  Now if know that it does that "incorrectly".
So I should either throw it away because one of the most
important criterias (ability to control noise level) does
not satisfy me anymore, or use it the "wrong" way as I did
for whole last year.  Ditto for 4 other asus motherboards
that have exactly the same problem.

Yes I know about acpi_enforce_resources.

Ok.  Now a pure technical question, finally.  Is there a
way to made asus_atk0110 to be able to *set* fan speeds
too, in a way as it's done by it87?

Because that's mostly the only issue with this driver,
and for me at least it's a show-stopper.

Thanks!
