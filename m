Yes, I'm not too sure either.

Ok, I missed those in the doco.

Right.

Now, maybe the best option is to have instead:

	fan[1-*]_discrete_value
		Discrete value
                RW

	fan[1-*]_supported values
                List of supported discrete values
                RO

IE. I like the interface to be self-explanatory rather than relying on
the user to know in advance what to write there. In which case I could
either use 0,1,2 as values or even "off, slow, fast".

I can then make a custom fancontrol script (or add a wart to the
existing one) to deal with this HW.

What do you think ?

Another option of course is to do the whole thermal control in a kernel
thread :-) That wouldn't be very hard nor take a lot of code, but I'm
sure I'll encounter resistance trying to merge that :-)

Cheers,
Ben.
