Hi Ben,

Sorry for the delay.

I have no objection.

Please don't try to add this to the fancontrol script. It's messy
enough as is ;) You probably want to implement the kernel part and the
user-space part together before you propose a standard interface,
otherwise it might be difficult to make the best decisions with regards
to attribute names and values.

Me, I wouldn't object. That's what you did for other systems as far as I
can see? As long as things work in the end, I have no problem with
fan speed control being in the kernel. Having it in user-space has its
share of issues (e.g. risk of overheating is the script dies for any
reason.)

But yes, others may complain.
