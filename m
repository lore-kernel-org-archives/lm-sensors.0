The purpose of the PNP system driver is to avoid conflicts with
*all* devices.  And if the PNP core were a little smarter, we
wouldn't need the system driver at all.  We don't have one for
PCI -- the PCI core manages resources for all PCI devices, even
ones that have no driver.

Why is 0x1000 a magic number?  drivers/acpi/motherboard.c used to
ignore IO port ranges that ended below PCIBIOS_MIN_IO (= 0x1000 for
most architectures).  I don't think Linux will assign IO ports below
PCIBIOS_MIN_IO to a PCI device, but the BIOS could, and I've seen
CardBus devices below PCIBIOS_MIN_IO.

I think having drivers/pnp/system.c ignore resources below
PCIBIOS_MIN_IO would be a hack that happens to cover up problems
like this without understanding the real cause.
