Indeed.  This would have to handled using interrupts based on the
generic gpio interface. (see the LIS3L02DQ driver on the SPI-devel
mailing list for an example of how this might work.)

Sure.  I'll get something put together and sent out asap. The general
form of this is going to look like a combination of the hwmon
interface via sysfs and something similar to the input subsystems
approach of using events sent over character devices.  The interesting
bit is going to be working out how to provide fairly generic interface
to ring buffers, whether these reside in the kernel or on the device
itself.

This is of course true, but there still seem to be some advantages in
providing some common interfaces for these devices.  Almost all
digital interfaced accelerometers share a number of common elements
not typically found in ADC's.  These include bias and gain as well as
commonly found alarm signals.  

Actually, on this point, it may well make sense to provide an
accelerometer driver that is designed to run on top of any generic ADC
driver, thus providing (based on a suitable board specific
configuration) userspace access to analog accelerometers connected in
this fashion.  This is definitely one for some way down the line!

Definitely, although to get a reasonable number of devices integrated
quickly they may not all support access to everything we would like
initially.
