I thought about it, but right now I have no idea how to make it work.
Initialization sequence in hwmon drivers is
    probe():
        allocate and initialize local driver data structures
    	detect configuration and initialize hardware if necessary
	create attribute files
	register with hwmon subsystem
	sometimes do additional work, such as enable interrupts

If I use attribute_group of the device_driver structure to create the attribute
files, my understanding is that those would be created prior to calling
the probe function.

This would be too early, since local data structures do not yet exist, and
the chip configuration is unknown and uninitialized.

On the other side, attribute files must exist before hwmon_device_register()
is called, since otherwise userspace would get confused.

If interrupts are supported, those are typically used to signal attribute
file related events (via udev and/or poll events), meaning the interrupts
must only be enabled after sysfs files were created (becaue the interrupt
acts on it), and should only be enabled after the hwmon device was registered
(because otherwise userspace won't know about the device if the first interrupt
happens after sysfs file creation but before hwmon registration).

I looked into the use of is_visible. The drivers I looked at (ad7877, tsc2005,
lm3533_led, lm3533-core, lm3533_bl) all need data obtained in the probe function
in their is_visible function, meaning the attribute files can not be created
before that data is available. That (and the solution to create the attributes
in the probe function after basic device initialization) is quite similar
to the problem we have in the hwmon subsystem and its current solution.

Overall I have no idea how to make this all fit into the generic attribute
file handling. If you do, please let me know.

Just look for device_create_file in the drivers/usb directory. Maybe I got it
all wrong, and everything is fine. Either some 50 calls to device_create_file
and 10 calls to sysfs_create_groups creeped in, or those (or at least many
of those) are fine. If the calls are fine, introducing devm_ functions to
replace at least many of those calls would make sense again.

Not necessarily - just shows that I don't understand the code.

Maybe it is not a problem because the input device is registered as input device
from its probe function, ie there is a sysfs event after its attribute files
were created. But if the use is ok, so would be supporting the use of devm_
functions in those drivers.

Unfortunately I have no ida how to make that all work. Can you point me
to some examples showing me how other subsystems solved a similar problem ?

I browsed through various drivers using is_visible, but none of the ones I found
really apply; almost all actually call sysfs_create_group in the probe function
and thus could use the devm_ API as well.
