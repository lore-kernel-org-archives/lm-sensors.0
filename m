With pwm zone I mean the number of different speeds which can be programmed
for one output channel, the temps divide the entire temp range into zones
(number of zones = number of temps + 1) and for each zone one can then
tell at what speed / pwm setting the fan should operate when the temperature
is in that zone.

Yes first splitting the attr in a separate patch would be very good.

I have a V0.27P datasheet for the 71889, but yes the fg suffix does not
seem to be mentioned anywhere in the datasheet not sure where it comes from.
I do know however that there are now new chips coming out with different
a and e suffixes so I suggest that we stay with fg for the old chips and
use a and e to distuingish the new ones.

Right.

Good.

Ack, if you could do that that would be great! Please do that
in a preparation patch though and not in the main patch.
