I think the question was more addressed to Guenter because he did not
try to help me to get involved with that patch. I did not mean to say
that I would have expected reviews within a week, but I would have
hoped for being more inclusive, i.e. trying to tell me what I am
doing, why, even if it is clearly broken. Please forgive me my
technical shortcoming. I am sure this would improve over time, just
like for anyone else here.

Currently, I am not there mentally to submit the patch set requested
by Lee because this situation is making me being afraid of a newbie
and submitting patches with issues. An expert may just come and
rewrite it, and then my effort is going again to "/dev/null". I guess
I will need some time and break to get over this...

That being said, I hope I will come back with peace of mind after the break.

PS.: I have submitted a patch set in December by the way, and got no
review from the hwmon maintainers for the hwmon parts. That patch is
still valid, and review would still be very welcome. The current
submission is pretty much just a direct port of it on top of the
latest mfd and upstream changes.
