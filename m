It does, though it gets complicated trying to use it for a case like
this since you can't really tell if the regulator was powered on
immediately before the device got probed by another device on the bus.

I'm not sure what the subsystem would do for such delays?  It's fairly
common for things that need this to also want to do things like
manipulate GPIOs as part of the power on sequence so the applicability
is relatively limited, plus it's not even I2C specific, the same applies
to other buses so it ought to be a driver core thing.

There was some work on a generic helper for power on sequences but it
stalled since it wasn't accepted for the original purpose (LCD panel
power ons IIRC).
