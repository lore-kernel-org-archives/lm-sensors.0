I'm not sure what do you mean (regarding "type"), but I think I got what
I wanted with the "monitoring_device" phandles (shouldn't it be
"_device*s*" then? ;-).

So what does this exactly mean? What is so special about CPU? What other
types you've got there? (Am I just lazy not looking at the numerous
links you provided? ;-)

The word "policy" doesn't sound to me like a "hardware feature",
wouldn't you agree?

Why is it a string? It seems very Linux-y... (cpufreq) Is there any
particular reason not to have phandles to the fans that have any impact
on the zone?

> 				weight = <100>; /* percentage */

Does this mean: how "successful" will be the particular fan?

You mean the zone nodes would live at the top level of the tree? To my
mind the root represents the device (the board, whatever you call it),
which, I guess, may be what you want, if the zone "covers" the whole
device? (as in: one fan and one sensor somewhere in the box and the only
thing you may do is to check the ambient temperature and start the fan
if it's to high)

You can include a dtsi inside the device node, no problem with that:

/dts-v1/;
        
/ {     
        smb {                   
                compatible = "simple-bus";

                /include/ "vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi"
        };      
};
