Hi Randy,

Here are a few random comments on your code, sorry for the delay.

Ranges are gone in -mm, please drop them. You should always base your
patches on -mm BTW, as this is what we will attempt to apply it against.

& 0xff isn't needed.

The above two functions suggest that a continuous read from the chip
would be very welcome (see my previous message). I even doubt anyone
would connect this kind of RTC to a bus NOT supporting I2C block reads,
because then other models would make more sense. So I'd suggest you use
I2C block reads (and SMBus block writes) here. If anyone really needs a
different access method, they can add it afterwards. Doing so will make
your driver much faster, smaller and more simple.

Which bus are you using this chip BTW, some bit-banging I2C?

Oh, and the ulong* vs. ulong cast is really ugly. Can't it be done
differently?

> +ulong new_time;

Shouldn't it be static?

Here you should check whether the adapter supports the I2C/SMBus
commands you are about to throw upon it. See how the other i2c chip
drivers do.

This is a *driver* flag, not meaningful nor suitable for a client
structure. Where did you copy that from?

You should have some kind of chip detection at this point. Failing to do
so, you may catch any chip at this address and misdrive it. Detection of
these chips is always a bit tricky, but you could do the following:

* Check the 6 zero bits of status register.

* If there are other register-based assertions, use them (I have no time
to read the full datasheet).

* See what happens when you try to read past the register count (0x0A
and above) in either individual byte or block mode. Sometimes it wraps,
sometimes it returns an error, sometimes in repeats the last register,
depends on the chip. This is a trick, but very useful in this situation.

You should kill the tasklet first, else it might try to use the client
after you freed it, right?

You don't need this ID, so you should just omit it. Also, it is
recommended to align structure declarations on the equal sign (using
tabs, not spaces), for a better readability.

Other comments:

1* Your driver construction makes it impossible to support more than one
device.

2* You seem to have two public functions in this driver, yet there is no
symbol export of these?
