Hi Linus,

Please pull from the git repository at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rzhang/linux.git next

to receive Thermal management updates for v3.14-rc1 with
top-most commit c698a4492f01127ca90fc28cd5157f3d616fe4ff:

  Merge branch 'misc' of .git into next (2014-01-06 22:48:19 +0800)


on top of commit dea4f48a0a301b23c65af8e4fe8ccf360c272fbf:

  Merge branch 'leds-fixes-for-3.13' of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cooloney/linux-leds
(2013-12-02 12:08:01 -0800)

This time, the biggest change is the work of representing hardware
thermal properties in device tree infrastructure.
This work includes the introduction of a device tree bindings for
describing the hardware thermal behavior and limits, and also a parser
to read and interpret the data, and build thermal zones and thermal
binding parameters. It also contains three examples on how to use the
new representation on sensor devices, using three different drivers to
accomplish it. One driver is in thermal subsystem, the TI SoC thermal,
and the other two drivers are in hwmon subsystem.
Actually, this would be the first step of the complete work because we
still need to check other potential drivers to be converted and then
validate the proposed API. But the reason why I include it in this pull
request is that, first, this change does not hurt any others without
using this approach, second, the principle and concept of this change
would not break after converting the remaining drivers. BTW, as you can
see, there are several points in this change that do not belong to
thermal subsystem. Because it has been suggested by Guenter R. that in
such cases, it is recommended to send the complete series via one single
subsystem.

Specifics:

 - representing hardware thermal properties in device tree
infrastructure.

 - fix a regression that the imx thermal driver breaks system suspend.

 - introduce ACPI INT3403 thermal driver to retrieve temperature data
from the INT3403 ACPI device object present on some systems.

 - introduce debug statement for thermal core and step_wise governor.

 - assorted fixes and cleanups for thermal core, cpu cooling, exynos
thrmal, intel powerclamp and imx thermal driver.

thanks,
rui
