No, definitely this patch series is *not* about mapping multiples
profiles for various use cases on device tree! This series is about
mapping *hw thermal limits* on device tree.

Again, this is about describing points and actions to avoid your hw
degradation. May be also useful to avoid end user harm.

This series is not about describing performance profiles.
