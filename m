Ok, luckily it does not appear to have caused any issues:

# i2cdump 0 0x2c b
WARNING! This program can confuse your I2C bus, cause data loss and worse!
I will probe file /dev/i2c-0, address 0x2c, mode byte

I am checking now...yes all HW monitoring/etc IS enabled.

Yep, see note above.  It is enabled.
