CONFIG_REGULATOR_DUMMY should never have been used in production, it was
a debug tool to help bringup but it broke things as often as it fixed
them particularly with init ordering which is why it generated a warning
when it was used. =20

The dummy driver is still there, if you're doing bringup you can hack it
in still or if you genuniely used it then specify that full constraints
are provided like the changelog says (and as I've previously said).

No, this would introduce breakage due to init ordering.
