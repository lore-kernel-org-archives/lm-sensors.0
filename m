Ok, say the HW SPI is pushed down to some lower level driver.  These
things send streaming data, and sometimes signals (free-fall detect) out
of band WRT the SPI comms.

I would like to see how a higher level API could encapsulate the
generalization of a class of such devices.

Also, I'm not sure how one could generalize SPI communications at a high
level given its bi-directional nature.

I guess I need to see some header files showing what you are thinking
about.

Keep in mind that one abstraction of these devices is they are simply
streaming A2D 16 bit data values over SPI (or I2C).  The size of the
data set is a function of the sensor axes.

I guess I need to see some header files to see where you are going with
this idea.  To be useful you'll also need to handle rotation sensors and
communicate the temperature bias's up the stack too.


good luck keep me posted on where your going with this, it is
interesting to me.
