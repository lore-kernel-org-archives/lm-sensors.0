Tricky indeed. We normally don't accept code like this in the kernel.

If code changes are desirable, let's just do them. You can do that in a
preliminary patch, and then your patch adding support for the
W83667HG-B goes on top of it.

I want you to touch that. Writing to non-existing registers is a bad
idea. You never know what actually happens when you do that.

OK.
