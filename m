Hopefully it is programming the W83627EHG at boot time and no longer
touching it after that. You can check
in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/device, some of the pwm*_enable files should
have value >=3D 2.

Correct.

Hmm. Is this "seemingly unrelated setting" the "Mainboard sensors"
panel? Maybe I get what's going on then. This panel gets the CPU
temperature from the ACPI "thermal" driver (/proc/acpi/thermal). Your report
suggests that the temperature value is taken from the W83627EHF's
temp2, which is in bank 1. If I am correct, then simply reading
from /proc/acpi/thermal/*/temperature would break the fan divider (when
my fixup patch isn't applied, that is.)

I recommend that you don't load the ACPI "thermal" driver together with
the w83627ehf driver, it won't give you any additional information and
the race condition that exists between both drivers can still result in
wrong values being reported from times to times (even with my patch.)

> So the BIOS seems innocent.

Good news.

One remaining mystery is why you did not observe the problem with the
older kernel. Maybe the ACPI thermal driver was not loaded (or not
working) back then?
