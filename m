As far as I can see, that patch set was not even tested, so how can it
go in? I was told that any patch should be _runtime_ tested, too.
Fwiw, I do not have time to test those personally, he would need to
find someone else if that requirement really holds true.

I would not really like to fix bugs appearing in that code to get my
features in.
