Thanks for the comments. I'll then move the GPIO driver back to
drivers/gpio and fix what Mark pointed out.

I Cc Richard Purdie, to have his maintainer view on the platform LED
declaration. Is it ok in the ts5500_led.c platform file, or should it
better be moved into drivers/leds/leds-ts5500.c, or maybe directly
declared in the main ts5500.c platform code?

Thanks,
Vivien.
