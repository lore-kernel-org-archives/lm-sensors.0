Multiple thermal zone devices may share the same hwmon device.
here is an example,
# grep . /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/*
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/name:acpitz
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_crit:127000
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input:40000
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp2_crit:100000
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp2_input:44000

temp1 and temp2 stand for different ACPI thermal zones.

This patch will break if the first ACPI thermal zone is unregistered
before the others, although it only happens theoretically.
Plus, as this is not a 1:1 binding, a symbol link from the hwmon device
to thermal zone device doesn't make sense.

Following is a possible solution which is also from Rene,
while I think CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON should be "default n".

thanks,
rui

Subject: [PATCH] acpi/thermal: allow disabling of thermal zone hwmon support

2.6.26-rc gained a hwmon interface to the Thermal Zone driver
which unfortunately breaks lm-sensors 2 userspace and renders
all other (subsequent) hwmon sensors inoperable also.

Many systems, current slackware and derivative systems among
them, are using lm-sensors 2 and would be affected. A new
lm-sensors 2.10.7 release is needed to fix this from the user
side.

This makes the hwmon support optional (enabled by default) and
comments that it needs a new enough lm-sensors userspace. This
also immediately schedules the option for removal again as this
is only intended to not break systems over the 2.6.26 upgrade
when new enough lm-sensors is not yet available or widely
deployed.
