No, you don't get what I'm saying. For PC users, the lm90 did not
request a regulator and things worked because the kernel isn't supposed
to take care about things like that on PC machines. Now that the lm90
driver does request a regulator, it fails on PC machines because no
regulator is declared.

PC users never had to do anything fancy to get the lm90 driver to work.
Just enabling the driver and loading it, did the trick. And that's
exactly how things must be. Hence my claim.

To be clear: my "before" is not referring to "before the dummy
regulator was dropped". It is referring to "before commit 3e0f964f2ad -
hwmon: (lm90) Add power control". I don't know a thing about all this
regulator stuff.

Regular PC. It has regulator API enabled, because it is possible to
enable it, I suppose, and developers try to test various combinations
of kernel config options. Guenter can tell more, I do not have it
enabled (which is why it did not fail for me, BTW.)

Don't tell me that it is expected that things will fail if
CONFIG_REGULATOR is enabled on a system which doesn't need it. It
doesn't make any sense. If kernels would fail as soon as any enabled
option wasn't actually needed, no system would boot out there.

If regulator is enabled but not needed, that's something the regulator
subsystem should figure out at run-time so that it can stub everything
out and things keep working.
