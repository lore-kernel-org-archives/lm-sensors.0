This one shows:

system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x29f has been reserved
(...)
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x294 has been reserved

This is clearly not correct as both areas overlap. The second
reservation is responsible for the it87 breakage, because it conflicts
with what the it87 driver later attempts to request (0x290-0x297). The
first is wrong as well (the IT87xxF environment controller I/O area is
8 port wide, not 16) but shouldn't be a problem in practice.

These port reservations weren't happening in 2.6.23.9 according to your
dmesg output for that kernel. I don't know what changed in this area
since 2.6.23.9, maybe Bjorn or Adam (Cc'd) can tell.

Either way, the overlapping areas smell like a BIOS bug, meaning that
you should look for an updated BIOS for your system first.
