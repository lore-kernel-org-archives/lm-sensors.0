This is good, thanks for the support.

Yeah, but I see your point. You probably want to have first code changes
done properly so that if we have code duplication, it does not spread
like a disease, like usually does. It is unavoidable to base new drivers
on existing ones. So better to get first converted drivers to be done
properly. I like this approach.

I see. Check patch 08/20 of this series. The driver had already
sensor/input id embedded in its own driver data. So, it was just a
matter of passing the complete driver data and then fetching id from the
passed driver data. Then again, that was only one case, if all other
potential API user drivers need to be modified to create their own
custom structure just for passing id, I definitely agree that it is
better to change the proposed API.

Yes the ids from DT and driver layer must match.

OK. So I assume you are proposing something like:
	.get_temp(struct device *dev, int id, long *temp);

right?

Yeah, I agree. The driver I chose were obviously based on the needs I
have to support the boards I have available/access.

OK. I agree that this patch series maybe does not take into
consideration the complete driver population. However, I must agree that
driver migration can be done latter. Actually on both sides that is
required, from thermal and from hwmon.

I was already prompted about the strategy on this subject. My plan is
still to settle first the DT bindings, then the layers and APIs, then
add support on driver side. In order to show that the proposal works on
all fronts, I picked a sample of drivers to make things working on
existing boards, like DRA7-evm, panda 4430 and 4460, OMAP5432-uevm,
where we have both SoC sensors and board sensors.

DT bindings seams to be the most hard part, as there is no well
settle/defined standard to follow. The closest we can have is ACPI,
which is not applicable fully, otherwise we wouldn't be having this
discussion. However, I believe now the binding is more or less defined.
But I didn't get an official ack from DT folks though.

In the end of the day, the APIs and driver support will be really well
defined when we convert most of the drivers. But I would like to this in
a separated patch series.

What is your view? Are you OK if we integrate this series as a first
step of the complete process?

I see. I think we need to take into account the driver needs while
converting them. Assuming you are seeing a need to have these
parameters, I would guess it is a good advice, based on the fact that
you know better the existing hwmon drivers.

Yeah, it is back to the point that I am taking small steps here.

The hysteresis, and other properties, like update rate, or limits, in
fact need to be propagated down to driver layer. This way, hardware
features like interrupts and counters can be properly configured. So
far, the code now handles this in the DT glue layer, which means, the
thermal framework will be polling the hardware.

OK.

Thanks for the good feedback.
