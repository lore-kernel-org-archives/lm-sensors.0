Hmm, this paragraph seems to indicate that you have not seen my
previous patch set. I tried to summarize in this commit message that
the type in this subdriver would need to change, yes.

I am fine with not renaming, but appending if such a thing is
possible. What does not make sense to me is acquiring a "global"
max665x name in a sub-device driver. The children have to be
distinguished somehow!

Exactly. This had been overdiscussed. I took my personal preference
without any technical drawback. I prefer clean separation just like
several other mfd drivers are doing, really.

Tell me this is unacceptable, and I will stop helping with getting the
required functionality into the kernel. Frankly, I am getting tired of
having worked on it for a few months now, and we are still at
discussing personal preferences rather than getting features in ...
