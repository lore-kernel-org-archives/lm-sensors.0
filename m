I personally do not see any problem with the code either way, hence I
would not personally touch what works. :)

But if it is a strong opinionated style restriction in the codebase,
then yeah, someone could do it, except me.

I am yet to understand the concept here. You were objecting to those,
so I removed this in MFD. I could add it to that back in this patch as
proposed.

This is a strange historical driver. It has always supported both, yet
it was named max6650 weirdly enough as you note.

Yes, sure.

Nowhere, so it was a sub-optimal situation in the old code. It is just
a direct platform device port of it whatever it was. Perhaps it is the
right time to clean it a bit, I agree.

I would need it for the bit fiddling, too, I think.
