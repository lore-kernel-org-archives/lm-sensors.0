I like some of the ideas here, but as you say, there are some
issues to work out.

The PNP core does not request resources for devices that are active
at boot.  Those resources currently don't get requested until a driver
claims the device.  I think this is a bug that we should fix.

I'm not a fan of IORESOURCE_SHARED.  I think that will make people
think it's acceptable to share a device between several drivers.  It
would be better to keep the ugliness of forcibly taking over a resource,
just as an incentive to clean up the drivers.

I think the best thing would be to reserve the PNP (including ACPI)
resources first, then the legacy things from setup.c.  I haven't looked
into that to see whether it's feasible.  Then you might have something
like this:

  0080-008f : 00:07 PNP0200
    0080-008f : dma page reg

I tripped over a couple of these when I changed the PNP core to request
resources for active devices.  The RTC is one; often BIOS says the RTC
is at 0x70-0x71 and 0x72-0x73, but the rtc drivers like to claim 0x8
(RTC_IO_EXTENT) ports.  However, I think the driver only *uses* two
ports, so we should change the driver to only request what it is
using.

Another case is the "dma1" region from e820.c.  Currently this is
0x0-0x1f, but most PNP0c02 devices only respond from 0x10-0x1f.  So
I think we should start by splitting "dma1" into 0x0-0xf and 0x10-0x1f.

I don't know what's up here; I haven't looked at this recently.

Assuming the BIOS describes the region correctly, I'd say a driver
that claims a larger region is buggy and should be fixed.
