I hope there's a plan to get rid of one of these? Having two macros
doing exactly the same thing will confuse everybody.

Jean has no preference when sleeping.

Now Jean is awake and can express himself on the matter:

* This isn't the kind of fixes we want to cherry-pick from. We're not
  fixing any bug here, are we? I certainly hope that a real bug fix
  wouldn't be hidden within a larger patch, but would have the separate
  patch it deserves. At which point we no longer care if the rest is
  one large patch or one patch per driver.

* I don't see us reverting that kind of patch either. If we don't like
  the changes for whatever reason, we don't take them in the first
  place. Once in, we're not going to change our minds.

* 32 patches for a simple cleanup is actually a lot more work for me
  than a single large patch. It's cheaper for me to do minor
  adjustments to a large patch than to apply 32 patches individually.

* That being said, now that the hwmon subsystem maintainer is a shared
  duty between Guenter and myself, there's no single place where we can
  keep a patch touching many drivers and ensure it doesn't conflict
  with the changes in the other tree. But I would think   this is
  something for Gunter and myself to sort out, not patch contributors.

I currently have pending patches to the following hwmon drivers in my
tree: adt7475, ams, asc7621, hdaps, it87, k8temp, lm75, lm85, lm90,
pcf8591, s3c-hwmon, w83795. Two of these are affected by Joe's
patch(es). Guenter, what about you?

Joe, would you mind providing a similar patch for the driver at:
  http://khali.linux-fr.org/devel/misc/w83795/w83795.c
This driver will be added to kernel 2.6.37.
