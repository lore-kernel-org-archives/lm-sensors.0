Hi All,

Firstly sorry for the huge cc list, but this series does get about.

This series came out of two separate lkml threads:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/13/64
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1148513/focust236

Basically Rusty and I both got annoyed with yet more instances
of the same cut and past ida allocation code for the very simple
case of wanting a unique id for some device. Tejun helpfully
joined the two threads up.

Anyhow, Rusty proposed more or less the first patch here (with a name
change requested by Tejun applied.)

The others patches are some of the more obvious looking cases for
applying this code.  My original reason was for IIO but those patches will
have to wait a little while for some prior changes to merge.
For reference, it saves about 40 lines there so I'm happy ;)

There are a number of other cases in tree that can be cleaned up
in a second series once these are sorted.

There are a couple of cases in here where I've carefully mangled
the error codes to keep consistent with the existing code.  Please
can people who know those subsystems well decide on whether the
mangling is necessary.

All comments welcome. I expect I've broken at least one driver
doing this so please take a close look.

Rusty, Tejun. I kept your sign of an ack for the first patch. Could
you quickly verify that's fine?

Thanks,

Jonathan

Jonathan Cameron (7):
  hwmon: convert idr to ida and use ida_simple interface.
  hwmon: ibmaem: convert idr to ida and use ida_simple_get
  [SCSI] use ida_simple_get and ida_simple remove in place of
    boilerplate code.
  drm/vmwgfx: use ida_simple_get for id allocation.
  [SCSI] osduld: use ida_simple_get to handle id.
  w1: ds2760 and ds2780, use ida for id and ida_simple_get to get it.
  rtc: class idr converted to ida and ida_simple_get used.

  ida: Simplified functions for id allocation.
