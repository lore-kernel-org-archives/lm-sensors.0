This is still BUG 71711
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?idq711

3.12.15 works very well
3.13.7 fails
3.14.0-rc8 fails

I've tried the tmon tool, now, too. Nice eyecandy and for monitoring!

I've tried to revert all "thermal" related patches from 
3.12.14->3.13.7 from 3.13.7. But they don't seem to matter. (Even 
if I apply the vice-versa patch to 3.12.15.)

So "thermal" is out?

For the failing kernels: Not any reached trip point (active) 
triggers ONE fan action!

Next would be ACPI, to be investigated,

THX for this audience,
Manuel Krause
