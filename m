Just be careful when you try to make thermal policy like decisions
based on this sensor. Placement of the sensor w.r.t the actual logic
generating heat has to be a factor as well. If you are just looking
for an approximation temperature (thermometerish kind), you might be
ok with this. I am not sure we'd find any TI data around this.. just a
heads up.

Also notice http://www.ti.com/lit/er/sprz278f/sprz278f.pdf "Advisory
3.1.1.186 MMC OCP Clock Not Gated When Thermal Sensor Is Used" I think
there were accuracy issues at certain values etc.. So remember to do a
off mode type PM tests as well before you consider requesting these to
be merged.
