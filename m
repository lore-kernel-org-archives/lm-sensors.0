Might make sense, but I would suggest to solicit feedback from others before
you do that. Specifically you'll need some guidance from the watchdog maintainer
and possibly from the mfd maintainer if your current solution is acceptable
or if the mfd solution would be better (ie more likely to be accepted).

If you move the lock handling to mfd, you probably want to name the file it87.c,
or maybe it87-core.c, to ensure that other functionality can be added to it
without having to rename the file.

That was ok.

This somehow didn't work. If you look at the kernel.org mailing list, it
did not recognize your series of patches as a single thread, but lists
it as independent posts.

You might want to play with that by sending series of patches to yourself 
and check if your mailer recognizes it as one thread.

See SubmittingPatches, #15. Add version information (ie what changed in which version)
after the "---" marker line, such as 

---
v2: Changed subject line to be meaningful, added description

One hint - the first comment line in each of your patches is a bit odd and should
not really be there. Keep in mind that everything up to the "---" line will end up
in the commit log unless the maintainer takes it out. The rest of the explanations
looked ok to me.

If you change the header file name and/or location, each of the patches will be affected,
so each of the patches should get a new version number. If you don't change anything,
don't resubmit (yet).

Thanks,
Guenter
