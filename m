The regulator code changed with 3.13; the dummy regulator no longer exists,
and the functionality it provided is supposed to be handled automatically.
But that only really works on devicetree based systems and otherwise returns
-EPROBE_DEFER as mentioned above.

Maybe there is some configuration option, or maybe something needs to be
configured from user space. I found neither. In the first case, we should create
a dependency for the LM90 driver; in the latter case, we would have to make sure
that it is well documented (I'd grumble on that, though - it would result in
never ending trouble for us, having to repeatedly explain how this is now
supposed to work).

Another possible fix would be to have the regulator core return -ENODEV
instead of -EPROBE_DEFER on non-dt systems. No idea if this would be acceptable
or even feasible.
