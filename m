OK, I get the idea.

Sorry for playing the devil's advocate here, but deciding that 0V is an
error is pretty arbitrary, and deciding that a negative voltage value
is an error is just as arbitrary. Just because these are not common
cases, doesn't mean they can't happen today or tomorrow for very
specific setups. I'd rather see a more robust way to notifier the
caller that an error happened.

OK, I get it. This indeed rules out ERR_PTR(-ENODEV). But what about
NULL? IS_ERR() doesn't catch NULL, so this wouldn't affect the current
users, as you never dereference the struct regulator pointer in the
stubs anyway. And at least it would let drivers that need it cleanly
differentiate between the cases of availability or unavailability of
the real regulator API. Something like (from the hwmon/sht15 driver):

/* If a regulator is available, query what the supply voltage actually is!*/
	data->reg = regulator_get(data->dev, "vcc");
	if (data->reg && !IS_ERR(data->reg)) {
		data->supply_uV = regulator_get_voltage(data->reg);
		regulator_enable(data->reg);
		/* setup a notifier block to update this if another device
		 *  causes the voltage to change */
		data->nb.notifier_call = &sht15_invalidate_voltage;
		ret = regulator_register_notifier(data->reg, &data->nb);
	}

looks much better than

/* If a regulator is available, query what the supply voltage actually is!*/
	data->reg = regulator_get(data->dev, "vcc");
	if (!IS_ERR(data->reg)) {
		int voltage = regulator_get_voltage(data->reg);
		if (voltage) {
			data->supply_uV = voltage;
			regulator_enable(data->reg);
			/* setup a notifier block to update this if
			 *  another device causes the voltage to change */
			data->nb.notifier_call = &sht15_invalidate_voltage;
			ret = regulator_register_notifier(data->reg, &data->nb);
		}
	}

IMHO. One less level of indentation, and one less intermediate
variable, too. What do you think?

I guess we could have ifdefs in hwmon/sht15, yes. But OTOH it looks
weird to have a complete stub API for the CONFIG_REGULATOR=n case, and
still require ifdefs from times to times. This is what make me believe
the stub API isn't good enough.

I second that. The stub API should only contain the minimum set of
functions that is required to keep drivers which don't depend on
CONFIG_REGULATOR ifdef-free. This will make its intended use case
clearer.
