Subject: [lm-sensors] [PATCH] lm90: Support the MAX6648/6692 chips
Message-Id: <20090302210106.GD6550@plum>
List-Id: <lm-sensors.vger.kernel.org>

The max6648 chip has nearly the same register set as the 6657 and
seems to have a working manufacturer/chip id so we can detect it.
This patch adds support for it.  Tested on a Nvidia Quadro FX 1500
card.
