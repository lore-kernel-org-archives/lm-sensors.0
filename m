Meanwhile Alexey Starikovskiy pointed me to the
acpi_ex_enter/exit_interpreter functions, which take an ACPI mutex
(ACPI_MTX_INTERPRETER). As the mutex already exists, it sounds more
efficient to just reuse it rather than introducing a new one. I made an
experiment with the f71805f driver on a machine where ACPI is accessing
the F71805F chip, and it appears to work fine; patch at the end of this
post is someone wants to take a look and/or comment.

Looking at the comment before acpi_ex_exit_interpreter raises two
questions though:

1* This suggests that the mutex could be released by the AML
interpreter in the middle of an SMBus transaction. If so, and if it
happens in practice, this means that we unfortunately cannot use this
mutex to reliably protect the SMBus drivers from concurrent accesses.
This even suggests that it's simply not possible to have a mutex we
take at the beginning when entering the AML interpreter and we release
when leaving the AML interpreter, as it looks like ACPI itself allows
interlaced execution of AML functions. Len, is this true?

What is the purpose of the ACPI_MTX_INTERPRETER mutex in the first
place, given that it seems it will be released on numerous occasions?
Is it to prevent concurrent AML execution while still allowing
interlaced execution?

2* What are "user-installed opregion handlers"? Are they something that
could help solve the ACPI vs. other drivers problem?

Thanks.
