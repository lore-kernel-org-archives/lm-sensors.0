I'll add configuration option to platform data or do you prefer some other
way to enable this?

It looks like the corrent way to do that. However, I don't have suitable environment
to do that right now. I need to study this more if I can somehow verify it.

 BTW, what is exactly the usecase for the "active" sysfs

That is exactly what it does. Input and freefall interfaces control the chip state
separately. So, this is only for sysfs interface since driver doesn't know
if somebody is using sysfs interface.

So this is the logic:
- If application wants to use sysfs, it must set 'active' to 1 (which is the default to
maintain backward compatibility).
Otherwise chip state is controlled by the number of users in
input and freefall device handles.
When 'active' is 0, only input / freefall device handles controls
the chip state.

When active is 0 but chip is enabled via input / freefall entries,
position entry returns error code. This is done to prevent the case where
chip is suddenly powered down when input  / freefall devices are closed. 
So position entry is working only when it is separately  enabled.

When there are no users at all, chip is powered down.
