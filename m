There's rather a lot of systems out there doing DVFS or using things like MMC
cards which would disagree with the idea that it's a bad idea to change supply
voltages at runtime. Even for fixed voltage supplies enabling and disabling at
runtime is useful to save power. I think it's fair to say that the overall trend is
towards more dynamic power management.

This tends to be done through paranoia more than anything else - people get
very worried about things like accidental writes to their PMICs.

Pretty much any current generation CPU can use dynamic voltage configuration
for DVFS.
