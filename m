This patch introduces a device tree bindings for
describing the hardware thermal behavior and limits.
Also a parser to read and interpret the data and feed
it in the thermal framework is presented.

This patch introduces a thermal data parser for device
tree. The parsed data is used to build thermal zones
and thermal binding parameters. The output data
can then be used to deploy thermal policies.

This patch adds also documentation regarding this
API and how to define tree nodes to use
this infrastructure.

Note that, in order to be able to have control
on the sensor registration on the DT thermal zone,
it was required to allow changing the thermal zone
.get_temp callback. For this reason, this patch
also removes the 'const' modifier from the .ops
field of thermal zone devices.

+* Thermal Framework Device Tree descriptor
+
+Generic binding to provide a way of defining hardware thermal
+structure using device tree. A thermal structure includes thermal
+zones and their components, such as trip points, polling intervals,
+sensors and cooling devices binding descriptors.
+
+The target of device tree thermal descriptors is to describe only
+the hardware thermal aspects, not how the system must control or which
+algorithm or policy must be taken in place.
+
+There are five types of nodes involved to describe thermal bindings:
+- sensors: used to describe the device source of temperature sensing;
+- cooling devices: used to describe devices source of power dissipation control;
+- trip points: used to describe points in temperature domain defined to
+make the system aware of hardware limits;
+- cooling attachments: used to describe links between trip points and
+cooling devices;
+- thermal zones: used to describe thermal data within the hardware;
+
+It follows a description of each type of these device tree nodes.
+
+* Sensor devices
+
+Sensor devices are nodes providing temperature sensing capabilities on thermal
+zones. Typical devices are I2C ADC converters and bandgaps. Theses are nodes
+providing temperature data to thermal zones. Temperature sensor devices may
+control one or more internal sensors.
+
+Required property:
+- #sensor-cells:	Used to provide sensor device specific information
+			while referring to it. Must be at least 1, in order
+			to identify uniquely the sensor instances within
+			the IC. See thermal zone binding for more details
+			on how consumers refer to sensor devices.
+
+* Cooling device nodes
+
+Cooling devices are nodes providing control on power dissipation. There
+are essentially two ways to provide control on power dissipation. First
+is by means of regulating device performance, which is known as passive
+cooling. Second is by means of activating devices in order to remove
+the dissipated heat, which is known as active cooling, e.g. regulating
+fan speeds. In both cases, cooling devices shall have a way to determine
+the level of cooling.
+
+Required property:
+- cooling-min-level:	A unsigned integer indicating the smallest
+			cooling level accepted. Typically 0.
+- cooling-max-level:	An unsigned integer indicating the largest
+			cooling level accepted.
+- #cooling-cells:	Used to provide cooling device specific information
+			while referring to it. Must be at least 2, in order
+			to specify minimum and maximum cooling level used
+			in the reference. See Cooling device attachments section
+			below for more details on how consumers refer to
+			cooling devices.
+
+* Trip points
+
+The trip node is a node to describe a point in the temperature domain
+in which the system takes an action. This node describes just the point,
+not the action.
+
+Required properties:
+- temperature:		the trip temperature level, in milliCelsius.
+- hysteresis:		a (low) hysteresis value on 'temperature'. This is a
+			relative value, in milliCelsius.
+- type:			the trip type. Here is the type mapping:
+	THERMAL_TRIP_ACTIVE	0:	A trip point to enable active cooling
+	THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE	1:	A trip point to enable passive cooling
+	THERMAL_TRIP_HOT	2:	A trip point to notify emergency
+	THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL	3:	Hardware not reliable.
+
+Refer to include/dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h for definition of these consts.
+
+* Cooling device attachments
+
+The cooling device attachments node is a node to describe how cooling devices
+get assigned to trip points of the zone. The cooling devices are expected
+to be loaded in the target system.
+
+Required properties:
+- cooling-device:	A phandle of a cooling device with its parameters,
+			referring to which cooling device is used in this
+			binding. The required parameters are: the minimum
+			cooling level and the maximum cooling level used
+			in this attach.
+- trip:			A phandle of a trip point node within the same thermal
+			zone.
+
+Optional property:
+- contribution:		The cooling contribution to the thermal zone of the
+			referred cooling device at the referred trip point.
+			The contribution is a value from 0 to 100. The sum
+			of all cooling contributions within a thermal zone
+			must never exceed 100.
+
+Note: Using the THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1L) constant in the cooling-device phandle
+limit parameters means:
+(i)   - minimum level allowed for minimum cooling level used in the reference.
+(ii)  - maximum level allowed for maximum cooling level used in the reference.
+Refer to include/dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h for definition of this constant.
+
+* Thermal zones
+
+The thermal-zone node is the node containing all the required info
+for describing a thermal zone, including its cdev bindings. The thermal_zone
+node must contain, apart from its own properties, one node containing
+trip nodes and one node containing all the zone cooling attachments.
+
+Required properties:
+- passive-delay:	The maximum number of milliseconds to wait between polls
+			when performing passive cooling.
+- polling-delay:	The maximum number of milliseconds to wait between polls
+			when checking this thermal zone.
+- sensors:		A list of sensor phandles and their parameters. The
+			required parameter is the sensor id, in order to
+			identify internal sensors when the sensor IC features
+			several sensing units.
+- trips:		A sub-node containing several trip point nodes required
+			to describe the thermal zone.
+- cooling-attachments	A sub-node containing several cooling device attaches
+			nodes, used to describe the relation between trips
+			and cooling devices.
+
+Optional property:
+- coefficients:		An array of integers (one signed cell) containing
+			coefficients to compose a linear relation between
+			the sensors described in the sensors property.
+			Coefficients defaults to 1, in case this property
+			is not specified. A simple linear polynomial is used:
+			Z = c0 * x0 + c1 + x1 + ... + c(n-1) * x(n-1) + cn.
+
+			The coefficients are ordered and they match with sensors
+			by means of sensor ID. Additional coefficients are
+			interpreted as constant offsets.
+
+Note: The delay properties are bound to the maximum dT/dt (temperature
+derivative over time) in two situations for a thermal zone:
+(i)  - when active cooling is activated (passive-delay); and
+(ii) - when the zone just needs to be monitored (polling-delay).
+The maximum dT/dt is highly bound to hardware power consumption and dissipation
+capability.
+
+* Examples
+
+Below are several examples on how to use thermal data descriptors
+using device tree bindings:
+
+(a) - CPU thermal zone
+
+The CPU thermal zone example below describes how to setup one thermal zone
+using one single sensor as temperature source and many cooling devices and
+power dissipation control sources.
+
+#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
+
+cpus {
+	cpu0: cpu@0 {
+		...
+		cooling-min-level = <0>;
+		cooling-max-level = <3>;
+		#cooling-cells = <2>; /* min followed by max */
+	};
+	...
+};
+
+&i2c1 {
+	...
+	fan0: fan@0x48 {
+		...
+		cooling-min-level = <0>;
+		cooling-max-level = <9>;
+		#cooling-cells = <2>; /* min followed by max */
+	};
+};
+
+bandgap0: bandgap@0x0000ED00 {
+	...
+	#sensor-cells = <1>;
+};
+
+cpu-thermal: cpu-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <250>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors = <&bandgap0     0>;
+
+        trips {
+                cpu-alert0: cpu-alert {
+                        temperature = <90000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_ACTIVE>;
+                };
+                cpu-alert1: cpu-alert {
+                        temperature = <100000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+                };
+                cpu-crit: cpu-crit {
+                        temperature = <125000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL>;
+                };
+        };
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		attach0 {
+			trip = <&cpu-alert0>;
+			cooling-device = <&fan0 THERMAL_NO_LIMITS 4>;
+		};
+		attach1 {
+			trip = <&cpu-alert1>;
+			cooling-device = <&fan0 5 THERMAL_NO_LIMITS>;
+		};
+		attach2 {
+			trip = <&cpu-alert1>;
+			cooling-device +				<&cpu0 THERMAL_NO_LIMITS THERMAL_NO_LIMITS>;
+		};
+	};
+};
+
+In the example above, the ADC sensor at address 0x0000ED00 is used to monitor
+the zone 'cpu-thermal' using its the sensor 0. The fan0, a fan device controlled
+via I2C bus 1, at adress 0x48, is used to remove the heat out of the thermal
+zone 'cpu-thermal' using its cooling levels from its minimum to 4, when it
+reaches trip point 'cpu-alert0' at 90C, as an example of active cooling. The
+same cooling device is used at 'cpu-alert1', but from 5 to its maximum level.
+The cpu@0 device is also linked to the same thermal zone, 'cpu-thermal', as a
+passive cooling device, using all its cooling levels at trip point 'cpu-alert1',
+which is a trip point at 100C.
+
+(b) - IC with several internal sensors
+
+The example below describes how to deploy several thermal zones based off a
+single sensor IC, assuming it has several internal sensors. This is a common
+case on SoC designs with several internal IPs that may need different thermal
+requirements, and thus may have their own sensor to monitor or detect internal
+hotspots in their silicon.
+
+#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
+
+bandgap0: bandgap@0x0000ED00 {
+	...
+	#sensor-cells = <1>;
+};
+
+cpu-thermal: cpu-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <250>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors = <&bandgap0     0>;
+
+        trips {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own trips */
+                cpu-alert: cpu-alert {
+                        temperature = <100000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+                };
+                cpu-crit: cpu-crit {
+                        temperature = <125000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL>;
+                };
+        };
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own cooling */
+		...
+	};
+};
+
+gpu-thermal: gpu-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <120>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors = <&bandgap0     1>;
+
+        trips {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own trips */
+                gpu-alert: gpu-alert {
+                        temperature = <90000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+                };
+                gpu-crit: gpu-crit {
+                        temperature = <105000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL>;
+                };
+        };
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own cooling */
+		...
+	};
+};
+
+dsp-thermal: dsp-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <50>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors = <&bandgap0     2>;
+
+        trips {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own trips */
+                dsp-alert: gpu-alert {
+                        temperature = <90000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+                };
+                dsp-crit: gpu-crit {
+                        temperature = <135000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+                        type = <THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL>;
+                };
+        };
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		/* each zone within the SoC may have its own cooling */
+		...
+	};
+};
+
+In the example above there is one bandgap IC which has the capability to
+monitor three sensors. The hardware has been designed so that sensors are
+placed on different places in the DIE to monitor different temperature
+hotspots: one for CPU thermal zone, one for GPU thermal zone and the
+other to monitor a DSP thermal zone.
+
+Thus, there is a need to assign each sensor provided by the bandgap IC
+to different thermal zones. This is achieved by means of using the
+#sensor-cells property and using the first parameter as sensor ID.
+In the example, then, bandgap.sensor0 is used to monitor CPU thermal zone,
+bandgap.sensor1 is used to monitor GPU thermal zone and bandgap.sensor2
+is used to monitor DSP thermal zone. Each zone may be uncorrelated,
+having its own dT/dt requirements, trips and cooling attachments.
+
+
+(c) - Several sensors within one single thermal zone
+
+The example below illustrates how to use more than one sensor within
+one thermal zone.
+
+#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
+
+&i2c1 {
+	...
+	adc: sensor@0x49 {
+		...
+		#sensor-cells = <1>;
+	};
+};
+
+bandgap0: bandgap@0x0000ED00 {
+	...
+	#sensor-cells = <1>;
+};
+
+cpu-thermal: cpu-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <250>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors = <&bandgap0	0>,
+		  <&adc		0>;
+
+		/* hotspot = 100 * bandgap - 120 * adc + 484 */
+	coefficients = 		<100	-120	484>;
+
+        trips {
+		...
+        };
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		...
+	};
+};
+
+In some cases, there is a need to use more than one sensor to extrapolate
+a thermal hotspot in the silicon. The above example illustrate this situation.
+For instance, it may be the case that a sensor external to CPU IP may be place
+close to CPU hotspot and together with internal CPU sensor, it is used
+to determine the hotspot. The hyppotetical extrapolation rule would be:
+		hotspot = 100 * bandgap - 120 * adc + 484
+
+The same idea can be used to add fixed offset:
+	passive-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <2500>; /* milliseconds */
+		hotspot = 1 * adc + 6000
+
+In the above equation, the hotspot is always 6C higher than what is read
+from the sensor ADC. The binding would be then:
+		/* sensor       ID */
+        sensors =  <&adc	0>;
+
+		/* hotspot = 1 * adc + 6000 */
+	coefficients = 		<1	6000>;
+
+(d) - Board thermal
+
+The board thermal example below illustrates how to setup one thermal zone
+with many sensors and many cooling devices.
+
+#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
+
+&i2c1 {
+	...
+	adc-dummy: sensor@0x50 {
+		...
+		#sensor-cells = <1>; /* sensor internal ID */
+	};
+};
+
+batt-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <500>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <2500>; /* milliseconds */
+
+	/* sensor       ID */
+	sensors = <&adc-dummy     4>;
+
+	trips {
+		...
+	};
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		...
+	};
+};
+
+board-thermal: board-thermal {
+	passive-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
+	polling-delay = <2500>; /* milliseconds */
+
+		/* sensor       ID */
+	sensors = <&adc-dummy     0>,
+		  <&adc-dummy     1>,
+		  <&adc-dymmy     2>;
+			/*
+			 * An array of coefficients describing the sensor
+			 * linear relation. E.g.:
+			 * z = c1*x1 + c2*x2 + c3*x3
+			 */
+	coefficients =		<1200	-345	890>;
+
+	trips {
+		/* Trips are based on resulting linear equation */
+		cpu-trip: cpu-trip {
+			temperature = <60000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+		};
+		gpu-trip: gpu-trip {
+			temperature = <55000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+		}
+		lcd-trip: lcp-trip {
+			temperature = <53000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			type = <THERMAL_TRIP_PASSIVE>;
+		};
+		crit-trip: crit-trip {
+			temperature = <68000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			hysteresis = <2000>; /* milliCelsius */
+			type = <THERMAL_TRIP_CRITICAL>;
+		};
+	};
+
+	cooling-attachments {
+		attach0 {
+			trip = <&cpu-trip>;
+			cooling-device = <&cpu0 0 2>;
+			contribution = <55>;
+		};
+		attach1 {
+			trip = <&gpu-trip>;
+			cooling-device = <&gpu0 0 2>;
+			contribution = <20>;
+		};
+		attach2 {
+			trip = <&lcd-trip>;
+			cooling-device = <&lcd0 5 10>;
+			contribution = <15>;
+		};
+	};
+};
+
+The above example is a mix of previous examples, a sensor IP with several internal
+sensors used to monitor different zones, one of them is composed by several sensors and
+with different cooling devices.
