[root@home up2date]# sensors-detect
 This program will help you to determine which I2C/SMBus modules you need to
 load to use lm_sensors most effectively.
 You need to have done a `make install', issued a `depmod -a' and made sure
 `/etc/conf.modules' (or `/etc/modules.conf') contains the appropriate
 module path before you can use some functions of this utility. Read
 doc/modules for more information.
 Also, you need to be `root', or at least have access to the /dev/i2c[-/]* files
 for some things. You can use prog/mkdev/mkdev.sh to create these /dev files
 if you do not have them already.
 If you have patched your kernel and have some drivers built-in you can
 safely answer NO if asked to load some modules. In this case, things may
 seem a bit confusing, but they will still work.

 BIOS vendor (ACPI): VT9174
 System vendor (DMI): VIA Technologies, Inc.
 BIOS version (DMI): 6.00 PG
 We can start with probing for (PCI) I2C or SMBus adapters.
 You do not need any special privileges for this.
 Do you want to probe now? (YES/no):
Probing for PCI bus adapters...
Use driver `i2c-viapro' for device 00:11.0: VIA Technologies VT8233A/8235 South Bridge
Probe succesfully concluded.

 We will now try to load each adapter module in turn.
Load `i2c-viapro' (say NO if built into your kernel)? (YES/no):
Module loaded succesfully.
 Do you now want to be prompted for non-detectable adapters? (yes/NO):
 To continue, we need module `i2c-dev' to be loaded.
 If it is built-in into your kernel, you can safely skip this.
 i2c-dev is not loaded. Do you want to load it now? (YES/no):
 Module loaded succesfully.

 We are now going to do the adapter probings. Some adapters may hang halfway
 through; we can't really help that. Also, some chips will be double detected;
 we choose the one with the highest confidence value in that case.
 If you found that the adapter hung after probing a certain address, you can
 specify that address to remain unprobed. That often
 includes address 0x69 (clock chip).

Next adapter: SMBus Via Pro adapter at 0500 (Non-I2C SMBus adapter)
Do you want to scan it? (YES/no/selectively):
Client found at address 0x30
Client found at address 0x50
Probing for `Serial EEPROM'... Success!
    (confidence 8, driver `eeprom')
Probing for `DDC monitor'... Failed!
Client found at address 0x69

 Some chips are also accessible through the ISA bus. ISA probes are
 typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
 this.  Do you want to scan the ISA bus? (YES/no):
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM78-J'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `National Semiconductor LM79'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `Winbond W83781D'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `Winbond W83782D'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `Winbond W83627HF'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `Winbond W83697HF'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `Silicon Integrated Systems SIS5595'
  Trying general detect... Failed!
Probing for `VIA Technologies VT82C686 Integrated Sensors'
  Trying general detect... Failed!
Probing for `VIA Technologies VT8231 Integrated Sensors'
  Trying general detect... Failed!
Probing for `ITE IT8705F / IT8712F / SiS 950'
  Trying address 0x0290... Failed!
Probing for `IPMI BMC KCS'
  Trying address 0x0ca0... Failed!
Probing for `IPMI BMC SMIC'
  Trying address 0x0ca8... Failed!

 Some Super I/O chips may also contain sensors. Super I/O probes are
 typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
 this.  Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no):
Probing for `SMSC 47M1xx Super IO Fan Sensors'
  Failed!
Probing for `VT1211 Super IO Sensors'
  Success... found at address 0x6000
Probing for `Winbond W83627HF Super IO Sensors'
  Failed! (0x3c)
Probing for `Winbond W83627THF Super IO Sensors'
  Failed! (0x3c)
Probing for `Winbond W83697HF Super IO Sensors'
  Failed! (0x3c)

 Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
 Just press ENTER to continue:

Driver `eeprom' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus Via Pro adapter at 0500' (Non-I2C SMBus adapter)
    Busdriver `i2c-viapro', I2C address 0x50
    Chip `Serial EEPROM' (confidence: 8)

Driver `vt1211' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus address 0x6000 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `VT1211 Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 8)


 I will now generate the commands needed to load the I2C modules.
 Sometimes, a chip is available both through the ISA bus and an I2C bus.
 ISA bus access is faster, but you need to load an additional driver module
 for it. If you have the choice, do you want to use the ISA bus or the
 I2C/SMBus (ISA/smbus)? ISA

To make the sensors modules behave correctly, add these lines to either
/etc/modules.conf or /etc/conf.modules:

#----cut here----
# I2C module options
alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
#----cut here----

To load everything that is needed, add this to some /etc/rc* file:

#----cut here----
# I2C adapter drivers
modprobe i2c-viapro
modprobe i2c-isa
# I2C chip drivers
modprobe eeprom
modprobe vt1211
# sleep 2 # optional
/usr/local/bin/sensors -s # recommended
#----cut here----

WARNING! If you have some things built into your kernel, the list above
will contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones! You really should
try these commands right now to make sure everything is working properly.
Monitoring programs won't work until it's done.

Do you want to generate /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors? (YES/no):
Copy prog/init/lm_sensors.init to /etc/rc.d/init.d/lm_sensors
for initialization at boot time.
