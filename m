Yes, we're working on that too. :)

I had a feeling you might say that. :)  I'll post a follow-up patch that
presents the power meters in mW instead of W.

Are there meters that can measure that small a quantity of power?  If
so, then I'll vote for uW; otherwise, mW is fine enough for me.

I don't know for sure, but my observation is that they're no more
accurate than a Watt.  Some of those meters appear to be averages, which
would explain why they occasionally have deciWatt components.

The IBM PEx meters are accessible via custom IPMI commands, not the
standard IPMI sensor interface.  I considered modifying the ipmisensors
driver, but reached the opinion that it would clutter that driver
unnecessarily, particularly since there are a lot of systems with IPMI
BMCs, but most of them will not have this interface.

That said, what is standing in the way of ipmisensors being merged?  I
think I can shake out some free time to apply TLC.
