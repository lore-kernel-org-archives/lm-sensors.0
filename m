Agreed, but it is how it is.

Might easily be. This might make a good interview question - I suspect many
if not most engineers would fail it. At least I would have until yesterday :).

Correct, which is why I did not try to fix it. Still worth mentioning, though,
in my opinion.

Agreed, though we should fix the problem now and think about reporting
afterwards.
