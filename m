This is surprising and might be where the alarm comes from. What output do
you
get if you load the coretemp driver ? 

coretemp-isa-0000
Adapter: ISA adapter
Physical id 0:  +38.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 0:         +36.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 1:         +35.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 2:         +35.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 3:         +34.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 4:         +37.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)
Core 5:         +38.0 C  (high = +81.0 C, crit = +91.0 C)

Are those not connected ?

The intrusion headers are not connected, also, I have not dug into it but
when you try to ignore the PECI or those PCH* lm_sensors seems to ignore the
rule.

sensors3.conf:
    ignore PCH_CHIP_TEMP
    ignore PCH_CPU_TEMP
    ignore PCH_MCH_TEMP

$ sensors  |tail -n 4
PCH_CHIP_TEMP:   +0.0 C
PCH_CPU_TEMP:    +0.0 C
PCH_MCH_TEMP:    +0.0 C

Ignoring intrusion works though:
    ignore intrusion0
    ignore intrusion1
