Does it mean the people cannot come up with ideas if they think
something may be better than some provided way? Surely, software
evolves over time and people are sometimes right, and sometimes wrong
right?

I can assure you that I do listen, please assume good faith with ideas
thrown in. If you think it is that bad an idea, you could have
explained why so, so that I and others can also understand it who do
not yet, right?
