Please stick with the ABI. libsensors won't be able to decode it if you make it
fancy, and it would violate the one-object-per-entry rule for sysfs attributes.

Good point ;).

Question is if you really need to reconfigure the chip. On X86 that should really have been
done by the BIOS. Only reasonable option here would really be to enable the chip
if it is disabled by default, and leave the rest to userspace based initialization
(ie use sensors3.conf to set desired values).

For most of the configured values (such as the update interval) it doesn't matter much
if you overwrite it when starting the driver. I am mostly concerned about the diode type,
which is the one relevant piece of configuration which should be known to the firmware
and should already be configured to the correct value when the driver is started. Even if
that is not the case with your board, it might and should be for other boards.

Thanks,
Guenter
