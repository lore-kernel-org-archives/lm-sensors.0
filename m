Why not ? Just keep a timestamp.

Possibly. I just thought about i2c since it also takes care of basic
devicetree bindings. Something along the line of
	if devicetree bindings for this device declare one or more
	regulators, enable those regulators before calling the driver
	probe function.

That was not intended to solve the delay problem, though. The delay problem
seems to be more of a generic regulator problem and, as I suggested, should
be solved in the regulator subsystem.
	if the regulator is enabled and the device specifies a poweron delay,
	wait for the specified amount of time after (and only after) enabling
	the regulator.

Too bad. I think it could be kept quite simple, though, by handling it
through the regulator subsystem as suggested above. A generic binding
for a per-regulator and per-device poweron delay should solve that
and possibly even make it transparent to the actual driver code.
