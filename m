If this changes we can always provide a more complex stub; for now we're
OK.

All we're doing is stubbing out the API so that common case clients
(which just want to switch on and off their supplies) don't need to
either depend on it or include lots of conditional code which could
easily end up masking error conditions.  The stub behaves as always
on fixed voltage regulators which matches what most systems that do
not use the regulator API actually have.

It's zero volts which is a reasonable out of range value for a
regulator.  We could change the API to return a signed value but I'm
having a hard time summoning the enthusiasm to do that myself.

Well, it did work in the sense that there's something there that
satisfies the expectations of many users.  We could change things so
that the consumers passed in a set of requirements for the regulator but
that'd be a bit mroe work and at the minute we're mostly relying on
silly combinations being filtered out at the hardware design stage.

Examples include failure to communicate with the hardware (so we don't
know what state it's in), or hardware that isn't actually doing
sufficient regulation to supply a voltage (many regulators support a
more efficient passthrough mode, and sometimes devices are connected
directly to unregulated supplies for efficiency reasons even if the
system mostly uses regulators).

Not really.  The overwhemling majority of users only do simple power
control, they don't need to get or set voltages and are only interested
in allowing the system to save some power when they're idle.  These
drivers don't even need the power to actually get switched off, they
just want to allow that possibility.  If we returned an error then all
these consumers would need to conditionalise all their regulator API
usage and find it hard to distinguish between not having any power and
normal operation without the regulator API.  With the current approach
these drivers can have a single code path which is used unconditionally
and will do the right thing on systems with and without the regulator
API.

The expectation is that users which have a strong requirement that the 
regulator API does more than this will need to depend on the regulator
API in Kconfig or have ifdefs and so never see the stubs though they
should still error check since individual operations may fail or not be
supported.

Looking again at the stubs we should remove the stubs for at least
setting voltages and current limits from the API since they don't
currently do the right thing and I can't think of any useful stub
behaviour.  The get operations are more useful as stubs since some
analogue parts can usefully have their configuration optimised if we
know their supply voltages but it's just a nice to have and not a
requirement.
