yes. it is supposed to be devices.

Hehehe. OK. Type is supposed to describe what your zone is representing.

Agreed. As I mentioned in other email, we can leave this to OS decide
what to use, by default, for instance.

Because fans are not the only way to cool your system, specially those
systems that don't feature fans. Managing the speed of your CPU is one
example of lowering temperature without fans. Managing the load on your
system is another way. These are obviously, virtual concepts. And
because we have physical ways and logical ways to cool the zone, then I
didnt put a phandle to a device there.

Yes, for cases that we want to map zones at board level, they could be
not embedded to a specific device node.

OK. got your point. What I was trying to highlight is that we could have
zones not inside device nodes, then we could write them in a thermal
dtsi. And in that case, you probably dont want to include the complete
file inside a device node.
