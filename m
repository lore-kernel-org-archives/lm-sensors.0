I wasn't able to take part in kernel development because I was heavily
involved in hardware development project. I always thought it would be just
a few more days, but then it became half a year. I know I should have given
an explanation and didn't. Sorry for that.

ACK to that one. It was never my idea to have a MAINTAINERS entry for that.
Jean Delvare suggested it, so it came in. The MAX6650 was in a project I was
working on 6 years ago, and I wrote the driver at that time. Meanwhile, I
don't even have hardware with a MAX6650 anymore.

Does each little driver really need a MAINTAINERS entry? In my opinion, it
should only be there if it is clear that it's not just a short project work.

Well, you can do that if you want. But I still feel associated with UIO
and sincerely hope I'm back again to fulfill my duties as a maintainer.

Thanks,
Hans
