Erm,

The superio sensor drivers only poke the superio chip registers without request 
region during the probe phase, iow they try to detect the chip, using a widely 
document and standardized (part of isa pnp AFAIK) procedure on standardized ports.

Let me try to explain a bit about superio chips, they have 2 superio control 
registers (an index and data register) with which things like a manufacturer 
and device id can be read, besides these id registers they also have a set of 
registers with config for different logical devices. Once the id is matched, 
the driver knows which logical device config to read, reads a (different) isa 
base address + range from the logical device config, and then does a 
request_region on the region actually used by the logical device.

The superio control registers are thus a sort of pci configuration space if you 
want, doing a request_region on these is not such a good idea, as multiple 
drivers (for different logical devices within the superio device) may use 
these, so trying to gain exclusive access will lead to troubles.

I hope with this info about the problem space, that you maybe have a suggestion 
on howto fix this?

Hans
