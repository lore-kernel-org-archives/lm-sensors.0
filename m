Hi Eduardo,

Apologies for having taken so long to get back you on this.

I have several comments on the binding and the way it's parsed.

I think "attachments" sounds a bit odd, though I don't have a better

I don't see why this needs to be at least one cell -- if an IC only has
one temperature sensor it should be fine for this to be zero and have no
ambiguity.

It may make sense to call these thermal sensor devices, there are plenty
of other sensors we might want to describe in the dt for other purposes,
and we can impose some consistency if we remove the ambiguity.

I'm not sure what a "cooling level" means. It seems a bit abstract. Is
this binding specific?

How does this relate to cooling-cells? These seem to be a fixed size.

Are these cooling cells always expected to cover min and max, and are
min and max always expected to take the same number of cells? The above
cooling-*-level properties imply they each take up one cell.

Does #cooling-cells = <3> make sense?. If this covers additional
information (e.g. which fan on a multi-fan controller), how does the OS
determine which cells are min and max, and how do these relate to
cooling-level-min and cooling-level-max?

I'm still not sure on this, as it sounds like embedding policy into the
DT, rather than a description of the hardware. I realise we need to
prevent devices burning out, so describing the max acceptable
temperature and possibly a preferred range makes sense, but do we need
this level of flexibility? Maybe we do.

Preferably, s/milliCelsius/millicelsius/ over the document.

Given that we have signed values elsewhere, is this signed or unsigned?

Why not use a string for this? We do so for other type parameters in
other bindings (see dr_mode in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/generic.txt, phy-mode for ethernet
PHYs, etc).

Might this be a list in general? The code doesn't have to support that
yet.

It would be nice to have a name for the cells after a phandle which
describe the cooling device's configuration. You've called them
parameters here, but it probably makes sense to call them a
cooling-specifier (following clock-specifier and interrupt-specifier).

This is a bit arbitrary. Couldn't we sum all contributions to find the
total automatically, so this could be a simpler ratio?

How about polling-delay-passive, polling-delay-active? I'm still not

As mentioned above, I'm not sure you even need that one cell.

- sensors:                A list of sensor phandle + thermal-sensor-specifier
                          cells describing the sensors monitoring the thermal

What is the end result of this? Presumably this is meant to result in an
estimate of the average temperature of the thermal zone, rather than an
arbitrary value? This should be mentioned.

This doesn't seem to be used the in the code below...

I'm not sure what you mean by this, could you elaborate?

I guess you mean that the delays should be chosen to account for said
max dT/dt, such that a device can't unexpectedly cross several trip
boundaries between polls?

What do those min and max mean in this context? What do the values in
the range [0,3] correspond to?

I'm not sure it makes sense to describe passive cooling in this way --
the precise way an OS does less work on a device is fundamentally tied
to the design of the OS (it might be able to rate-limit requests, it
might be able to clock the device down, it might only be able to turn
the device off).

I'm not sure there is anything we can describe for passive cooling
(beyond the thermal limits the OS should attempt to stick to).

Aha, so these are signed. This *must* be mentioned in the documentation.
The types of all properties should be described in their definition.

This is the first instance of "thermal-zones" in this patch. Presumably
this is the container for thermal zones that allows them to be probed
(answering my question above). This *must* be described in the binding.

Why? I fail to see why a single sensor *must* have some configuration cells.

That wasn't described in the binding. Should this be reading the
"contribution" property?

Ah, so the first two cells are meant to be min and max, not any
arbitrary cells. Why is this necessary?

No sanity checking?

I'd prefer a string and a table from string to Linux internal ID. Others
may have differing opinions.

Inconsistent '-' and '_' between the parsing and the error.

Same here.

What if there are no children, or this fails (returning zero)?

> +       tz->trips = kzalloc(tz->ntrips * sizeof(*tz->trips), GFP_KERNEL);

Here kzalloc could return ZERO_SIZE_PTR ((void*) 16). So the check below
isn't sufficient to stop us continuing if the node has no children. We
should check tz->ntrips above before calling kzalloc.

What if this fails for a child node?

What about all that useless data we may have just allocated memory for?

So each child of thermal-zones must be a thermal zone (we can't embed
other nodes of information)?
