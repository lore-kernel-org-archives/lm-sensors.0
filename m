I beg to disagree. The Linux 2.6 device driver model focuses on clear
separation between device instantiation and driver initialization. When
you properly stick to the model, both steps are totally separate, and
even happen in different modules, so device instantiation and
initialization can have no effect on the driver, which can even
pre-exist.

The code we have here is different because there's no device instances
being created, and no device driver binding taking place. But following
the spirit of the model, device initialization should still not affect
the success of driver loading.

Note BTW: Fenghua's patch will have to be rebased, as the following fix
went in the way meanwhile:
