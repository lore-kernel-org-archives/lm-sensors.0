I'd like to add something at this point.

We have historically created the hwmon attributes in the hardware (i2c,
platform...) device, and then created an empty hwmon class device on
top of it so that libsensors etc. can locate all hardware monitoring
chips on the system. This is probably wrong and this may explain the
difference of views between Greg and Guenter.

I suspect that ideally all hwmon-related attributes should belong to the
hwmon-class device and not the physical device. Would doing so solve
the problem of is_visible() needing chip-specific information that can
only be gathered during probe()? Sure this is an interface change, but
a few hwmon drivers already do it that way (the ones without an actual
hardware device, e.g. ACPI thermal zones) and libsensors supports this
since version 3.0.3, which was released in September 2008 - 4.5 years
ago.

This would require creating the attributes after calling
hwmon_device_register() rather than before, but from the ongoing
discussion I seem to understand that the driver core supports creating
the attributes for us, possibly at the same time as the class device
will be created. Would this solve the userspace timing issue?

Also note that libsensors is really old fashioned when it comes to
device discovery. It doesn't support hot-plug nor hot-remove. So some
work would be needed in this area anyway if we want libsensors-based
applications to properly cope with device addition and removal.

Just my 2 cents.
