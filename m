Yes, it is, and the latest news are that there were no problems with
the k8temp driver, it was a false alert.

True, and we are stepping back on this. See:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=3Dlinux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=3Dcomm=
it;h=9208ee8286ea2c0136a4bc58638b0295bad791c8

However, it's not so easy, as I have been explaining to Pavel lately.
Some machines have the ACPI vs. lm-sensors conflict while the SMBus
wasn't hidden. On others, the SMBus was hidden and there was no
conflict. So we are not going to just stop unhiding the SMBus and fix
all the problems that way. It's neither necessary, nor sufficient. The
decision must be taken independently for every motherboard / laptop.

Legacy ISA hardware monitoring chips (W83781D, W83782D, LM78, LM79)
were indeed probed at an arbitrary address (0x290). I pretty much doubt
that these old chips are found on systems with (working) ACPI though.

More recent "ISA" hardware monitoring chips are embedded in Super-I/O
chips, they are in fact LPC devices, not ISA. The base I/O address is
read from the Super-I/O configuration space, (0x2e/0x2f or 0x4e/0x4f),
just like serial ports, parallel ports, floppy disk controllers, IR,
etc. So these devices _are_ enumerated. Sometimes they are also listed
as PNP devices.

As for I2C/SMBus devices, they are indeed not enumerated. But I fail to
see why non-enumerated devices would be the sole properly of ACPI.

Interesting theory, but how does it fly in practice? Not much, I guess.
I doubt you could do any useful with an ACPI-enabled system today
without any non-ACPI driver.

Asus does things like this, yeah, but I don't remember any other vendor
having such ACPI methods. It would make sense to write a driver for
this Asus stuff. One of the problem we have in hardware monitoring
drivers is that we usually don't know how the chip is wired on a given
motherboard. The ACPI data might help.

For the other vendors, my assumption is the same as yours: they either
ignore the conflict, or have proprietary, undocumented ways to get
around it. After all, there must be a reason why there is no native
sensors support in Windows and every vendor provides it's own tool.
