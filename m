This patch (and the other) have been in Mark's tree for a month or so. 
(linux-next <- useful!)

Mark has been pretty, umm, low-key lately.  I've attached the full
git-hwmon changelog below and the authors of all those changes are
cc'ed.

Could people please confirm that what is in linux-next is still the
latest and greatest version of their changes?  If so, I shall plan on
fishing those changes out of there and getting them into -rc2.

Thanks.

    hwmon: (lm85) Simplify device initialization function
    
    Clean up and simplify the device initialization function:
    * Degrade error messages to warnings - what they really are.
    * Stop warning about VxI mode, we don't really care.
    * Drop comment about lack of limit initialization - that's the standard
      way, all hardware monitoring drivers do that.
    * Only read the configuration register once.
    * Only write back to the configuration register if needed.
    * Don't attempt to clear the lock bit, it locks itself to 1.
    * Move the function to before it's called, so that we no longer need to
      forware declare it.

    hwmon: (lm85) Misc cleanups
    
    Misc cleanups to the lm85 hardware monitoring driver:
    * Mark constant arrays as const.
    * Remove useless masks.
    * Have lm85_write_value return void - nobody is checking the returned
      value anyway and in some cases it was plain wrong.
    * Remove useless initializations.
    * Rename new_client to client in lm85_detect.
    * Replace cascaded if/else with a switch/case in lm85_detect.
    * Group similar loops in lm85_update_device.
    * Remove legacy comments.

    hwmon: (lm85) Don't write back cached values
    
    In set_pwm_auto_pwm_minctl, we write cached register bits back to the
    chip. This is a bad idea as we have no guarantee that the cache is
    up-to-date. Better read a fresh register value from the chip, it's
    safer and in fact it is also more simple.

    hwmon: (lm85) Drop dead code
    
    Drop a lot of useless register defines, conversion macros, data structure
    members and update code. All these register values were read from the
    device but nothing is done out of them, so this is all dead code in
    practice.

    hwmon: (lm85) Coding-style cleanups
    
    Fix most style issues reported by checkpatch, including:
    * Trailing, missing and extra whitespace
    * Extra parentheses, curly braces and semi-colons
    * Broken indentation
    * Lines too long
    
    I verified that the generated code is the same before and after
    these changes.

commit ea6db11742de63324f29d1383122657cabe90940

    hwmon: (lm75) add new-style driver binding
    
    More LM75 updates:
    
     - Teach the LM75 driver to use new-style driver binding:
    
         * Create a second driver struct, using new-style driver binding
           methods cribbed from the legacy code.
    
         * Add a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (for "newER-style binding")
    
         * The legacy probe logic delegates its work to this new code.
    
         * The legacy driver now uses the name "lm75_legacy".
    
     - More careful initialization.  Chips are put into 9-bit mode so
       the current interconversion routines will never fail.
    
     - Save the original chip configuration, and restore it on exit.
       (Among other things, this normally turns off the mode where
       the chip is constantly sampling ... and thus saves power.)
    
    So the new-style code should catch all chips that boards declare,
    while the legacy code catches others.  This particular coexistence
    strategy may need some work yet ... legacy modes might best be set
    up explicitly by some tool not unlike "sensors-detect".  (Or else
    completely eradicated...)

    hwmon: (lm75) cleanup/reorg
    
    Minor cleanup and reorg of the lm75 code.
    
     - Kconfig provides a larger list of lm75-compatible chips
    
     - A top comment now says what the driver does (!) ... as in, just
       what sort of sensor is this??
    
     - Section comments now delineate the various sections of the driver:
       hwmon attributes, driver binding, register access, module glue.
       One driver binding function moved out of the attribute section,
       as did the driver struct itself.
    
     - Minor tweaks to legacy probe logic:  correct a comment, and
       remove a pointless variable.
    
     - Whitespace, linelength, and comment fixes.
    
    This patch should include no functional changes.  It's preparation
    for adding new-style (driver model) I2C driver binding.

    This patch gets rid of a couple of macros previously used for sysfs attribute

    more readable and maintainable. It also fixes an issue with pwm5 & pwm6
    attributes not being created read-only initially.
