Might make sense to document it in the ABI, though.

I am opposed to non-ABI attributes. That doesn't mean that I am opposed to
extending the ABI; if the ABI needs to be extended, it should be extended
instead of providing non-standard attributes. But there should be a use case
for extending the ABI - meaning new ABI attributes should provide value not just
for one chip, but for others as well.

sysfs attributes should only be used for values expected to change during
runtime. "resolution" and "heater_enable" sounds like it might fit better into
platform data. System wide information can also be set using driver parameters.

Yes.
