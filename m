Well I don't think there is anything terribly complicated there - but I 
tried to make it simpler. Below patch seems to work better for me for my 
normal workload - I got no failures or other oddities with the default 
32ms timeout. I haven't tried very hard to get to the corner cases which 
earlier required a higher timeout. 

I would like to get this in for now if there aren't any further 
suggestions, as it fixes the failures by making it use the 
32ms maximum it was originally supposed to and for bonus it's also 
converted to use usleep_range which is better from PM standpoint.

Henrik - if the below patch still results in failures we can 
revisit the long  wait cases. For now I am satisfied that there aren't any 
normal case failures like before.

Thanks,
