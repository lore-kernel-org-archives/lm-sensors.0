Hello,

A picture of it is available here:

A close up of the chip itself!

Is this the chip to which you are referring?

Winbond
W83677HG-i
919S9BE918B001FB
919S9BE918B001FB*typed twice to confirm (same #s on two different 
board/reviews)

Is there anything else needed?

This site shows a close up of nearly every part of the board:

Thanks,

Justin.
