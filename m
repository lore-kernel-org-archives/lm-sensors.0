In the thermal_zone_device_register(), it has following codes:
    if (tz->tzp)
            tz->governor = __find_governor(tz->tzp->governor_name);
    else
            tz->governor = __find_governor(DEFAULT_THERMAL_GOVERNOR);

It mean if the tz->tzp is not NULL, and the governor_name is NULL, then
the __find_governor() will return NULL, so the tz->governor is NULL, it
can't fall into the default governor. And in the of-thermal driver, it
call the thermal_zone_device_register(), and pass the "tzp" without
governor_name.
I think if we want to change the governor in user space, we need to fix
this first.

The thermal_zone_device_register() support to set the governor which you
want, but with the of-thermal framework, it only support to set to
default governor, if fix above issue. I think the driver which use the
of-thermal should be able to set to any governors which it want, in its
initialization. So I add the function thermal_update_governor().
