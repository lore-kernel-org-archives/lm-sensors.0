It also points at the possibility of a smaller patch to test, but I
have not had the time to check this very deeply myself:

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] applesmc remedy take 2

Conjectured problem: there are remnant bytes ready on the data line
which corrupts the read after a failure.

Remedy: assuming bit0 is the read valid line, try to flush it before
starting a new command.

Tests by Chris suggests reading the status is enough for the problem
to go away, which is consistent with a change in the SMC interface,
where the number of bytes to read is no longer specified, but found
out by reading until end of data.

Tested on a MacBookAir3,1, but the original problem has not been
reproduced.
