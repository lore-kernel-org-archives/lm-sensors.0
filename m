(This is an attempt to do a bit of review after the fact. See, this
appears to be to the patch that ended up as commit
9d97e5c81e15afaef65d00f077f863c94f750839 in the mainline tree. Since
that tree is at v3.2-rc2 now this might be in time for v3.2. If my
comments have merit, that is.)

It doesn't look like that Kconfig symbol is part of the tree just yet.
That means people will not be able to build this driver from the
mainline tree. Why is this dependency needed? In a (rather quick) scan
of the code of this driver I couldn't spot anything not yet available in
the tree.

A common idiom seems to be (I'm speaking from memory here) to
wrap .suspend and .resume inside an "#ifdef CONFIG_PM" / "#endif" pair.
That would allow to drop both "#define exynos4_tmu_suspend NULL" and
"#define exynos4_tmu_resume NULL" above. Would that work here too?
