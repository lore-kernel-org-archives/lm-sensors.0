My reply is reflecting the frustration coming from the wasted man
months caused by the miscommunication. I cannot step over it easily I
am afraid. Please assume good faith though... I was writing this in
the hope of this situation never ever happening again, so everyone
feels better in the future.

If I can also drop in my two cents, I would like to note that I also
feel bad about the no sign of regret.

My post was not actually about compatibility... It was about the fact
that there was no alternative way presented what should be done. That
is, not in an understandable way for me at least.

In any case, please consider rejecting "global names" for MFD chips in
the future for hwmon. This is my personal two cents.

Sorry, but I wished to raise the maintainer issue regardless how you
take them. I can assure you that I have done it only with good faith,
so the same mistake never ever happens again.

That being said, I really do not understand what you are writing, so I
guess I would need more details to proceed. Please give a more
thorough explanation that newcomers can also understand. Currently, it
is unclear to me what you are trying to write.

I already asked in the beginning of this thread if it is possible to
add the alternative ids to the list instead of renaming them. I do not
seem to have gotten replies to that.

I personally think you are underestimating the issue here. As far as I
can tell, the datasheet is pretty short for this chip, and someone
reading it through surely gets the idea this chip is not at all about
just hwmon. I am not saying people do not do mistakes, but I am
encouraging you to learn the lesson with good intention so that this
can be avoided in the future.

Perhaps the datasheet was not read completely, and the feature was
added haskily... I do not know, but currently I cannot imagine it
otherwise.

No, I have not understand it, sorry. Could you please elaborate more?
