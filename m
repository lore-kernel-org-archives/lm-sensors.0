+Description provided by Dave Pivin @ Andigilog:
+
+Andigilog has both the PECI and pre-PECI versions of the Heceta-6, as
+Intel calls them. Heceta-6e has high frequency PWM and Heceta-6p has
+added PECI and a 4th thermal zone. The Andigilog aSC7611 is the
+Heceta-6e part and aSC7621 is the Heceta-6p part. They are both in
+volume production, shipping to Intel and their subs.
+
+We have enhanced both parts relative to the governing Intel
+specification. First enhancement is temperature reading resolution. We
+have used registers below 20h for vendor-specific functions in addition
+to those in the Intel-specified vendor range.
+
+Our conversion process produces a result that is reported as two bytes.
+The fan speed control uses this finer value to produce a "step-less" fan
+PWM output. These two bytes are "read-locked" to guarantee that once a
+high or low byte is read, the other byte is locked-in until after the
+next read of any register. So to get an atomic reading, read high or low
+byte, then the very next read should be the opposite byte. Our data
+sheet says 10-bits of resolution, although you may find the lower bits
+are active, they are not necessarily reliable or useful externally. We
+chose not to mask them.
+
+We employ significant filtering that is user tunable as described in the
+data sheet. Our temperature reports and fan PWM outputs are very smooth
+when compared to the competition, in addition to the higher resolution
+temperature reports. The smoother PWM output does not require user
+intervention.
+
+We offer GPIO features on the former VID pins. These are open-drain
+outputs or inputs and may be used as general purpose I/O or as alarm
+outputs that are based on temperature limits. These are in 19h and 1Ah.
+
+We offer flexible mapping of temperature readings to thermal zones. Any
+temperature may be mapped to any zone, which has a default assignment
+that follows Intel's specs.
+
+Since there is a fan to zone assignment that allows for the "hotter" of
+a set of zones to control the PWM of an individual fan, but there is no
+indication to the user, we have added an indicator that shows which zone
+is currently controlling the PWM for a given fan. This is in register
+00h.
+
+Both remote diode temperature readings may be given an offset value such
+that the reported reading as well as the temperature used to determine
+PWM may be offset for system calibration purposes.
+
+PECI Extended configuration allows for having more than two domains per
+PECI address and also provides an enabling function for each PECI
+address. One could use our flexible zone assignment to have a zone
+assigned to up to 4 PECI addresses. This is not possible in the default
+Intel configuration. This would be useful in multi-CPU systems with
+individual fans on each that would benefit from individual fan control.
+This is in register 0Eh.
+
+The tachometer measurement system is flexible and able to adapt to many
+fan types. We can also support pulse-stretched PWM so that 3-wire fans
+may be used. These characteristics are in registers 04h to 07h.
+
+Finally, we have added a tach disable function that turns off the tach
+measurement system for individual tachs in order to save power. That is
+in register 75h.

+aSC7621 Product Description
+
+The aSC7621 has a two wire digital interface compatible with SMBus 2.0.
+Using a 10-bit ADC, the aSC7621 measures the temperature of two remote
diode
+connected transistors as well as its own die. Support for Platform
+Environmental Control Interface (PECI) is included.
+
+Using temperature information from these four zones, an automatic fan speed
+control algorithm is employed to minimize acoustic impact while achieving
+recommended CPU temperature under varying operational loads.
+
+To set fan speed, the aSC7621 has three independent pulse width modulation
+(PWM) outputs that are controlled by one, or a combination of three,
+temperature zones. Both high- and low-frequency PWM ranges are supported.
+
+The aSC7621 also includes a digital filter that can be invoked to smooth
+temperature readings for better control of fan speed and minimum acoustic
+impact.
+
+The aSC7621 has tachometer inputs to measure fan speed on up to four fans.
+Limit and status registers for all measured values are included to alert
+the system host that any measurements are outside of programmed limits
+via status registers.
+
+System voltages of VCCP, 2.5V, 3.3V, 5.0V, and 12V motherboard power are
+monitored efficiently with internal scaling resistors.
