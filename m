I was hoping that emc2103 driver will work for my Yoga 13 laptop with
EMC2104 chip but I had no luck with sensors-detect nor loading the
emc2103 driver manually (compiled with additional "debug" with no
luck).

isadump produces following output:

I'm sure that it is EMC2104 because I opened my laptop case and found
that chip on mainboard. Any other things I could try?

Thanks,
Igor
