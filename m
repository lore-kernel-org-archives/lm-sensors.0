Sounds like a good idea. Let me think about it; maybe I can come up with something.

You are absolutely right. I forgot that this is used to compile the core module.
Sorry for the noise.

The API got rid of the list and reduced the code size by about 25 lines.
Definitely a winner.

Makes sense, only I'll have to clean up the status when loading the driver, before
starting to do any register checks. I'll see what I can do.

Except per discussion above, I'll see if I can remove the one at the top of the function.

I added more description at the top of the function. Hope it is a bit clearer
in the next version.
