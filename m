What are you actually trying to do here?

Converting mJ/ns to uJ/s?

Or do you want to convert mJ/ns to Watt in which case you should
multiply "time" with 1000 instead of dividing it through 1000?

In any case you should only need one expensive 64bit division
and you can fold the operation with 1000 into the second division.
