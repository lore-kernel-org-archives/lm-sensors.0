I'll look into it and send a patch.

I mean that this is one more thing to check when reviewing a new
driver: did the author use msecs_to_jiffies or msecs_to_jiffies_min.
But that wasn't a good point from me, I'll admit, as we already have to
check if the timeout value is set properly.

My point is that a backported driver can't use a function which was
added in a later kernel version than the backport target. Either the
missing function must be backported as well (but most often this isn't
an option) or some compatibility code must be thrown in. Even though I
agree that backporting isn't a primary concern and should never prevent
good changes from happening upstream, I think it is a gentle reminder
that changes should only be done when we're sure they are worth the
effort. I am maintaining two dozens of standalone hwmon drivers to be
used with older kernels, and the less work I have to do on these, the
more time I can devote to more interesting tasks.

You're welcome.
