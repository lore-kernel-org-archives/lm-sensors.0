Maybe study the Pro2.dll from Asus Probe II?

Ok.

Fan3 is disabled because the chip is programed to disabled - (IO pin)

It loads now. I have moved my extra fan to some other connector, now it is fan1 
for w83627EHF chip.

ATK0110 ATK0110:00: registering hwmon device
ATK0110 ATK0110:00: populating sysfs directory

Although it says it has been registered to hwmon class, I cant find it in sysfs. 
I have loaded/unloaded the driver several times before I checked the dir, so 
maybe is something wrong?

Does it show up in your /sys/class/hwmon?

Thanks,

Rudolf
