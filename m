There are more than one example in this file. Even explaining why
cooling min and max are used, and the difference of min and max
properties that appear in cooling device and those present in a cooling
specifier. Cooling devices and cooling state are described in the
paragraph above.

Well that sentence is arguable. It is not like all properties in DT are
standardized as ranges, is it?

It is the other way around. For a person designing a thermal
representation for a specific board it is intuitive to think about
hysteresis in this case. It is a better representation because we are
really talking about a hysteresis here in order to give some room for
the system to react on temporary temperature transitions around that
point. It is possible to use ranges as you are suggesting, but it
becomes confusing.

But within a board there could be more than one active cooling actions
that could be done, it is not a 1 to 1 relation. Same thing applies to
passive cooling. The binding does not imply a specific action. Just the
trip type.

There are cases in which cooling devices don't need to use all states
for cooling, because either lower states does not provide cooling
effectiveness or higher states must be avoided at all. So, allowing
drivers to report this thermal info is possible, but questionable
design, as you would be spreading the thermal info. Besides, for the
example I gave, the driver would need to know board specifics, as the
range of states would vary anyway across board.

Please read my explanation above.

ditto.

Please also read the examples I gave in the thermal binding. There are
case that the designer may want to assign a range of states to
temperature trip points. This binding is flexible enough to cover for
that situation. And without the representation of these limits it would
be hard to read the binding. It is not redundant data, please check the
documentation.
