I always assumed that there was no way to know in advance if a
Super-I/O (LPC) chip was present or not, let alone the exact model of
the chip. The I/O addresses are decoded by the Super-I/O chip itself,
and in general it has no relation to PCI. And I've never seen ports
0x2e/0x2f nor 0x4e/0x4f listed in /proc/ioports.

But of course if there is a way to know, we should use it. Avoiding
random access to I/O ports, even if they are relatively standard in
this case, is always good.

Good.
