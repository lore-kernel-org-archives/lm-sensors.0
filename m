Hi Clemens,

Sorry for the late answer...

Indeed, we may want to add an standard name for this.

Correct. That being said, nothing prevents us from changing the base to
whatever we want it to be, pretty much by definition of relative
temperature reports. For example we could report 0 for temp1_max and
(register value - 70000) for temp1_input.

I agree (again, unless we always change the base to be one of these
meaningful points... but I'm not sure if we want to do this.)

Not correct. For some variants of the Intel Core, we do not known the
max limit. I'm not even sure if the max limit value exists.

I agree that we shouldn't waste time designing an interface for
something that doesn't exist. All I'm saying is that, if we are adding
something to the interface today and it's not trivial, we should make
it reasonably flexible so that we don't have to do it all again next
year or so. Otherwise the interface could turn quite complex and
unappealing.

Maybe, yes. I am a little worried that older versions of libsensors
will ignore this attribute. The good thing about this is that users
will still get some value until they upgrade. The bad thing is that
they will not know that the value isn't absolute. They are likely to
get frightened by unexpected values and/or to complain to us about them.

I am wondering if a totally separate channel type wouldn't be
preferable. The pros and cons would be inverted of course: older
versions of libsensors would have zero support for that, and all
applications would have to be updated to support it, but at least the
meaning of the value would be totally clear. This would come at the
price of some code duplication both in libsensors and applications
though.

I guess it basically depends whether we want to consider a thermal
margin as a "temperature measurement except that it's relative" or as
something completely separate. Honestly, I've been thinking about this
for some time now and I simply don't know what we'd rather do :(

> Hmm, which drivers use millivolt temperatures?

vt1211, vt8231, pc87360. These devices use thermistors for temperature
measurements, they measure the voltage at the pin (exactly as for a
voltage input) and leave it to user-space to turn the voltage value
back into a temperature value. The exact conversion formula depends on
the thermistor model and the value of the resistor used for the second
part of the bridge.

Note that virtually every chip monitoring voltages can be used to
monitor temperature instead, using thermistors. And this was seen once
already:
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.sensors/14564/
We do not have support for this at the moment though.
