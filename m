I have addressed Guenter's comments in the revised patch below - I've 
minimized the deviation from the original code - only thing additional is 
usleep_range which I believe is a good thing to do.

I initially experimented with different max wait values and came to the 
conclusion that 0x20000 was good enough to reduce the errors to zero. But 
then Guenter pointed out that the original loop terminated too early - 
that means it only waited 16 ms instead of 32. I then corrected the loop 
termination but kept the original 32ms max wait and used usleep_range() 
instead of udelay() - testing with this gave me no errors whereas earlier 
the errors were readily reproducible and significant in quanity.

So I guess actually sleeping for 32ms along with the upward variability 
introduced by usleep_range() is helping with the fix.

Since we are keeping the changes minimal and using the same 32 ms max wait 
as originally intended I think this patch can only make things better. It 
sure does make things better on my machine but it will not hurt to test it 
on other models.
