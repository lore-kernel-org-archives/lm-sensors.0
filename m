This is actually by construction; The total wait time after the loop
is done is roughly 2^MAX_WAIT_TIME.

The current patch does exactly the same sleeps, the only difference is
that the test is also done before the first sleep. Thus, the increased
delay, if any, comes from the sleep range.

The MBP10,1 experiences a lot of write errors with this patch.

Net result: new delay function and one more status test.

Causes (lots of) write errors on MBP10,1.
