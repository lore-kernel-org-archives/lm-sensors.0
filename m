Ok, there is a division here between interrupt handling on the host side
which indeed should be turned on and off transparently by the driver 
and actually telling the sensor which interrupts to generate.  In a sense
this is simply a case of terminology and what is actually being requested
is event notifications (which then match with those sent up to userspace).

Oops, silly habit that one - I'll clean those out.

Yup, definitely need to clean them up.

Good point - I'd droped to indio in some cases but iio will make those 80
character limits even easier ;)

At the moment the ring buffer has to be a whole number of datums big.
I'm inclined to keep it way and move more towards dynamic allocation
such that it is true than to try handling split data reading sets.

Ouch.  That's an out and out bug!

Good point, I'd forgotten you could do that with unions.

Good approach, I'll switch to that.

Not sure, I'll look into it.

Thanks for the comments.
