For me, a bug in devicetree data would be if a wrong gpio pin is assigned ... if
a wrong clock frequency is specified, or a wrong clock input. I would not expect
a clock rate or pin assignment to be played around with to find the optimal
setting. Either it works or it doesn't.

Note that we don't really talk about pure thermal limits here. We are talking
about association between thermal sensors and cooling devices, which is much
more abstract and not as well defined as clock pin assignments. In many case,
more than one cooling device exists, and there is no well defined means to cool
the system. It may be cooled with a fan, or by reducing the CPU clock speed.
There may be multiple fans interacting with each other, and not all may be
present at all times. There may be secondary cooling options if primary cooling
fails (eg reduce CPU speed or increase speed of a secondary fan if a primary fan
fails).

Yes, I understand you need a means to describe thermal profiles. Putting one of
those into DT and declaring it to be the "absolute thermal limit", however, is
really just asking for putting other thermal profiles into DT as well ..
if you want a different thermal profile, just load a different devicetree, and
possibly make it configurable in BIOS/ROMMON. Of course you can declare that not
to be "intentional", but what do you think would happen in the real world ?
Do you really think anyone would bother putting one profile into DT and others
into some other database ? Not really, especially if the kernel would not even
support reading that other database. And if it would, you would not need the
DT data in the first place.

This is completely different to the intended use of devicetree information.
An instance of devicetree data should be tied to a specific piece of hardware.
Changing it may enable or disable pieces of that hardware, but change its
operation, as in "optimize for performance" or "optimize for low power
consumption" ? Yes, again, I understand you are saying that this is not the
_intent_, but that is what it enables.

Other but related subject .. from a thermal / hwmon driver's perspective, if
such a driver supports thermal subsystem, it should just register itself as
thermal sensor device, because that is what it is. If and how it is tied to
cooling devices should be part of the thermal subsystem and be decided there.
I don't think it is necessary for a thermal sensor to read devicetree data
in order to determine if it is supposed to register as thermal device or not.
That _is_ configuration and does not describe hardware - the mere fact that
a thermal sensor exists in the system already identifies it as thermal sensor
device, not anything in devicetree data. This would be similar to, say, a clock
device. A clock is a clock, and registers itself with the clock subsystem even
if there is no consumer. Sure, its interconnection with clock consumers would
be determined by devicetree data, but that is a different subject. So, even if
devicetree maintainers accept your definition of thermal profiles as hardware,
I think your approach is still wrong, and a thermal sensor device should
register itself as thermal device independently of its association with
cooling devices.

Thanks,
Guenter
