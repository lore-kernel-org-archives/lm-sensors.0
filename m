Ultimately, you are making my point here. If you considered it, did you ask
devicetree experts for an opinion ? Did you discuss the subject on the
devicetree-discuss mailing list ? If so, what was the result ?

Yes, me too, or more widely the devicetree community. This is exactly
why I brought it up.

I am not a devicetree expert. One of the complaints by the devicetree
folks is that much is added to devicetree which should not be there.
I find this use case questionable. Maybe I am wrong and it isn't,
which may well be. But you thought about it as well, so I don't think
I am that far off track.

This needs to be discussed and determined by devicetree experts, not me.
I'll be happy with your patch series if you get an agreement or an Ack
by the devicetree maintainer for your patch series.
