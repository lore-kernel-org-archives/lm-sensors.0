I have seen the list. I don't think you should fix everything in one go. 
First step might be to get the w83697hf and it87 to work together, then
go from there. 

Is there a reason for loading (or trying to load) both the it87 and
the w83697hf driver at the same time ? Those drivers are usually only
loaded if the respective chip is known to exist. If there is no reason
to try loading both drivers, a simple workaround would be to not do it.

Thanks,
Guenter
