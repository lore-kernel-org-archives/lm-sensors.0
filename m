I have no objection to the core idea, it's great :-)

Yes, that's pretty much what I had in mind.

I do agree the duplication in a single driver is minor. However I
expect more hwmon drivers to be converted to cooperate with the thermal
subsystem in the future. Duplicated code adds up, in terms of build
time, storage space and run-time memory consumption. Plus it hurts CPU
caching even though I don't expect these code paths to be particularly
hot.

OTOH I suppose that the compiler will inline lm75_reg_to_mc() in this
specific case, saving one function call. It wouldn't possibly inline
lm75_read_temp() so it is quite possible that your implementation
actually performs better than what I am suggesting.

We're speaking of hardly measurable differences anyway. My other point
below is probably more important...

Are you talking about void *dev? OK, you can virtually pass anything in
that pointer, but...

I am worried that this won't be practical at all for the real world
cases. I expect that most drivers will need to pass the device plus one
index-like value. Having a single void pointer for that is certainly
flexible but it will also be inefficient, as every driver will have to
define its own custom structure to embed the needed information. You
_do_ pass a sensor_id to thermal_zone_of_sensor_register() so it
shouldn't be hard to pass it to the callback function(s) as well
(assuming the indexing in the device tree matches the one done by the
driver - I certainly hope so.) I'd even suggest passing the device
unconditionally too, as I just can't see how a driver could do without
it. If you pass the right parameters then you may not even need a void
pointer.

I agree. But two drivers are probably too few to make an educated
decision, I suppose we'll need to convert some more to get a clearer
view. Note that most things can be changed later if needed, so my
comments aren't meant to block the integration of your patches.

We do not have that structure (struct device *, int index) ready yet,
so we'd have to add it to every driver with more than one input. We
could have a generic structure for that in some header file, to avoid
the duplicated work, but if we need to do that, I'd say this is a good
hint that we settled for the wrong API in the first place.

No comment on that? I'd expect the get_temp() callback to take an extra
parameter so that it can return the value of a specific subfeature, for
example INPUT, HOT, CRITICAL etc. Or leave get_temp() as is but add a
get_trip_temp() callback to retrieve limit information (not sure if
thermal zones can have more than one limit?)

I think thermal zones support hysteresis as well, and so do many hwmon
drivers. It seems unfortunate that your proposed "bridge" between the
hwmon and thermal subsystems doesn't map all the features which are
supported on both sides.

I think exactly what I wrote above, no more no less. I don't think I
can add anything, and the decision is up to you.
