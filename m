Yes I realize now that time_after() vs. time_after_eq() guarantees
already that we wait at least data->update_interval. Moreover +1 was
there to wait more than this, so clearly my change here was incorrect.

Agreed, this describes the intention better.

True. This could be solved by turning the macros into uninlined
functions.

Not sure what you mean by this. Having a properly named helper instead
of just writing +1 makes it more obvious what the intention was and
easier to spot places that are doing the wrong thing.

This would be the case for places where the adjustment is already there
and we would just make this more explicit with the new helper. But for
places we actually fix in the current code backporting the fix would be
a benefit.

A was planning to send a patchset with the actual fixes after there is
some consensus that the approach is viable at all..

I think there is a clear benefit.

Ok, this particular change was done without enough thought and we should
drop it, but I hope you agree we need a generic solution for this
problem.

Thanks a lot for the review and thoughts,
Imre
