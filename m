Not to worry ;)  I was just taking advantage to drop in a plug.
It's certainly going slower than I would like and I'm fully in favour
of drivers going into misc or similar even if we would like to
eventually take them into IIO. This is part of the reason we
have been trying to pin down interface naming etc in a more
general forum than our internal list.   Basically we are trying to
avoid a repeat of the ALS debacle.

Yup, Dmitry has softened somewhat on this point for device where it really
can be argued that input is the key feature (typically the ones being used
for exactly this purpose in smart phones) in recent months so things may
have changed.

Lets wait and see.
