I don't like the whole trend thing.

I've been writing hwmon drivers for the past decade and I've never seen
a thermal sensor device being able to report trends. And as a rule of
thumb, if the hardware can't do it then the (hardware-specific) drivers
should not report it.

Hwmon devices (and drivers) report temperature values, and sometimes
historical min/max. They can do that because these are facts that need
no interpretation.

Defining a trend, however, requires care and, more importantly,
decisions. For example, consider a thermal sensor which reports 50=B0C at
time t, then 47=B0C at time t+3s, then 48=B0C at time t+6s. At t+7s someone
asks for the trend, what should the driver reply? If you consider only
the last 5 seconds, temperature is raising. If you consider the last 10
seconds instead, temperature is dropping. How would the driver know
what time frame the caller is interested in?

Another example: "small" temperature variations. If temperatures varies
by 1=B0C in my kitchen's oven, I'd call it stable. If my body temperature
varies by 1=B0C, I'd call it non-stable, and my doctor for an appointment
also ;-)

My point is that only the caller, and not the driver, knows how to
convert a series of measurements into a trend. So I don't think drivers
should implement anything like get_trend(). Whatever piece of code
needs to establish a trend should call get_temp() repeatedly, store the
results and do its own analysis of the data.
