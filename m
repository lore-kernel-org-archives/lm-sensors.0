This series implements a mechanism to detect if the chip is in its POR state
and reinitialize it if needed. It also extends the sysfs interface to make the
driver configurable at run-time.

The shunt_resistor attribute allows to change the shunt resistance value
at run-time in cases where ina2xx used to do the measurement isn't integrated
with the shunt.

The avg_rate attribute allows to increase/decrease noise reduction.

v6:
- moved the chip initialization and calibration to a separate function and
  extended the update_device function to check if the chip hasn't been
  reset and, if so, reinitialize it,
- added a new variable to struct ina2xx_data which holds current configuration
  value in order to be able to restore the config after a reset and reinit,
- decided to keep the rshunt value in ina2xx_data in order to be able to
  restore the shunt value when reinitializing the device,
- other minor fixes and improvements,

v5:

Bartosz Golaszewski (5):
  hwmon: ina2xx: reinitialize the chip in case it's been reset
  hwmon: ina2xx: remove a stray new line
  hwmon: ina2xx: don't accept shunt values greater than the calibration factor
  hwmon: ina2xx: make shunt resistance configurable at run-time
  hwmon: ina2xx: allow to change the averaging rate at run-time
