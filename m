"map" or "mapping" is better?

It means cooling ability of a cooling device, such as speed of a fan.
But it is better to use cooling-min/max-state I think, because the 
thermal management code is using "cooling state", concepts in dt and c 
should be identical.

I also think cooling-cells is redundant.

Putting platform data into dt is acceptable, right?
In a narrow sense, trip points are platform data, but in a broad sense, 
both trip point itself and its corresponding cooling device are all 
platform data.

It means the speed level of a fan. Even if a fan can run at a continuous

This is for adding/removing cooling device dynamically.
