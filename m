I mean, the definition I commented about is completely confusing. You
should rewrite it in a more readable way. For example, "Cooling state is
an unsigned integer which represents level of cooling performance of
a thermal device." would be much more meaningful, if I understood the
whole idea of "cooling state" correctly.

By example I mean simply listing one or two possible practical meanings,
like "(e.g. speed level of a cooling fan, performance throttling level of
CPU)".

No, they are not, but property range is a common concept of representing
range of some values.

Anyway, I won't insist on this, as it's just a minor detail. However I'd
like to see comments from more people on this.

Probably it depends on what you are used to. I'd like to see opinion
of more people on this.

I'd prefer the "active" and "passive" states to be renamed an their
descriptions rephrased. In general, the idea of having just four trip
point types seems like bound to a single specific hardware platform.

That's a wild guess, but maybe having an unsigned integer to represent
trip point "attention level" would be a better idea?

One thing is the allowed range of cooling states supported by the
cooling device and another is the range of states that are usable on
given board. The former is a property of the cooling device that
in most cases is implied by its compatible string, so to eliminate the
bad data redundancy, you should not make the user respecify that. The
latter you have as a part of your cooling device specifier tuple.

As an example of this, see PWM, GPIO or IRQ bindings. You don't have
{pwm-channel,pwm-duty,interrupt,gpio}-{min,max} properties, because this
is not needed by respective PWM, GPIO or IRQ drivers, as they already
know these parameters.

I don't see any problem with just dropping the min and max properties.
All the use cases you listed above will still work, as you have the
cooling state limits included in cooling device specifier.
