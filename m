Well, yeah. thinking of this series now I probably should have mentioned
clear that it is not ready for merge. Not only because it depends on a
working in progress I have referred at [1], but because we lack
completely dra7 files (at linus tree we have no files under
arch/arm/boot/dts/*dra7*).  Therefore, I mentioned in this cover letter
that I actually based this work on top of [2] and [1]. Apologies if it
was not clear enough for you.

Just to make clear, the intention of this patch set was to share and use
yet another example of the usage of the work at [1]. Thus the audience
was directed to the cc and to lists I used.

Well sure, once it has the right dependency in place.

I believe, once we have them merged, then I suppose this diff is applicab=
le.
