I think all that Tomasz is arguing for is an inline definition of what a
"cooling state" is. I don't think that will lead to that much confusion.

How about something like:

Any cooling device has a range of cooling states (i.e. different levels
of heat dissipation). For example a fan's cooling states correspond to
the different fan speeds possible. Cooling states are referred to by
single unsigned integers, where larger numbers mean greate heat
dissipation. The precise set of cooling states associated with a device
(as referred to be the cooling-min-state and cooling-max-state
properties) should be defined in a particular device's binding.

I think a brief inline description would be helpful. I am happy for it
to be in a later amendment.

I think if these are needed the set of types can be extended, no?

It's not quite a probable property though. It's more of a
system-specific recommendation. A system intended for use as an
always-on HTPC might recommend always having a quiet fan on at a low
speed rather than suddenly bringing it up at high speed when the board
gets hot (and making a lot of noise that spoils the experience).

I think the question is more is this appropriate for DT? I can't see a
better place to put it without having board files. It's also worth
noting that we can add the appropriate knobs to override this if
preferred.

I would expect that at some point someone is going to want to mess with
these values, and I they should be allowed to (within reason). While
it's likely you can under-cool a device, it's not so likely that you can
over-cool it...

However, I think that can change in future.

Thanks,
Mark.
