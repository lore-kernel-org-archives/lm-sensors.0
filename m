I haven't done the research, but it might be keep superio as
a platform driver, and keep the clients as platform drivers.  Only
have the superio driver probe and discover the subcomponent
addresses and then create the platform devices as children
instead of having each driver create its own platform device.
(This all assumes they are all platform devices in sysfs, I have
not looked).

This is all because in the platform bus the bus driver does not
discover the addresses but relies on drivers or platform setup code.

Well, that is the second time you asked me, so I guess I should respond.

While I it is possible for me to write this patch, my schedule and
priority list predict it would not be before the merge window closes.  
In
fact, I'm not sure when it would come out.   It might be argued it could
go in early -rc, but I would fear somebody's chip will not be detected
with the additional check.  For example, the port may reserved as mother
board resources or something.  Also, I have no hardware to test any
proposed patch, so it would be compile check only.
