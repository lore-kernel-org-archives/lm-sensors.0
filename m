Apologies about the delay, I was "otherwise engaged" for a week...

I hope you haven't lost all motivation to work on this subject, as it's
really worth the while!

Would this create any particular problem at the driver/framework side?

Believe me, I'm trying to be as fair as possible :-) and I see a lot of
value in describing the thermal properties of the platforms in the tree.
It's just that we really want to focus on describing the hardware, not
policies. And as you have already spent so much time on the matter, you
are in the best position to find the best set of *physical* properties
that would allow to make the right decision in the code. Could you,
please, try to make one step back and have another look at the problem?
What input data (as in: numbers :-) would you need to get what you want?
Are those numbers characteristic to the specific device (they probably
should live in the driver than) or to the board/platform (tree without a
doubt).

Thanks!

Pawel
