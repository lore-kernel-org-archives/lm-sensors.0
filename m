Hi Alex,

The NULL check is presumably there to catch the (impossible) case
ARRAY_SIZE(ucd9000_id) = 0 (array of ids is empty), not the case "no
id is matched". The initialization of mid to NULL is for the same
reason. Both should be unnecessary but may have been motivated by a
compiler warning (although I would think gcc is smart enough to not
emit these when it can check that the array isn't empty.) Guenter
should be able to tell more.

The check for "no id is matched" is !strlen(mid->name), which works as
intended as far as I can see. Did you actually hit a bug with the
current code? I bet not.

Now I would agree that the current code is somewhat misleading because
mixing null-terminated arrays with ARRAY_SIZE() is unusual (and
inefficient - the last iteration always fails.) Also, strlen() is
relatively slow and would rather be avoided when only testing if a
string is empty or not: it's faster to test for mid->name[0].

So if anything I would propose the following changes (for performance
and readability, NOT bug fix), untested:
