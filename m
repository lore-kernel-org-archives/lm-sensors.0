I've thought about it before and rejected the idea at that time, because
I thought it will add more abstraction then actually needed.
But at that time the adc driver was not a hwmon driver yet and thus
didn't pull in the whole hwmon framework if you only wanted to use the
battery driver.
But the more I'm thinking about it now it might actually make sense to
move the common code to a MFD driver.

There is no touchscreen driver yet. But if I'm going to remove the
reference I'm pretty sure that someone will come up and ask why it
actually is necessary to have a separate driver instead of putting all
the code into the battery driver.

Hm, right, it does not. Interestingly the datasheet does not tell the
unit of the returned data, but I found a formula in the datasheet for a
similar SoC.

Thanks for reviewing the patch.
