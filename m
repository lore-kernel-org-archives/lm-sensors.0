Note: a more recent version of lm-sensors would give you additional

I would like to know what it is doing exactly, and how. Can this
feature be disabled? If the BIOS accesses the W83627EHG chip in our
back, this can cause lots of trouble, such as what you are seeing.

Note: 89 RPM with div=3D64 corresponds to the same register value as 1424
RPM with div=3D4 (as shown in your next post). As if the chip and the
driver didn't agree on what the actual divider is.

Divider should be 4,not 16, methinks.

You can dump the chip registers using the following command:
isadump 0x295 0x296
=46rom now on, whenever you paste the output of "sensors", please dump
the contents of the chip too and include the output.

No idea. The new driver can only increase, not decrease, the clock
divider when you poll for a speed value. So the change above (from 128
to 16) is not supposed to happen. However... I also can't explain why
the original reading is 0 (with div=3D128). A reading of 0 only happens
if the divider is too low (i.e. less than 16.) If the driver increased
the divider to 16, it means that it was previously 8, not 128.

Now, given how dividers are encoded:
128 -> 111b
 64 -> 110b
  8 -> 011b
  4 -> 010b

See the pattern? The case fan's clock divider reads 128 when it is 8,
the CPU fan's clock divider reads 64 when it is 4. In both cases, it is
the most significant bit that is wrong. And it happens that this bit is
in a separate register (VBAT, 0x5d), which happens to be in the banked
register range of the W83627EHG (0x50-0x5f).

So my theory is that something else (BIOS, ACPI?) is changing the bank,
probably to read temperature values which are in banks 1 and 2, causing
the w83627ehf to get a wrong value for the VBAT register. If I am
right, then the attached patch should help. Please give it a try and
report.

Mark: the previous version of the driver was initializing the fan mins.
This wasn't needed, however the bank was reset to 0 as a side effect
when initializing fan5_min. When removing the unneeded code, I caused
the initial bank value to become undefined. This explains in part the
odd behavior reported by Stefan. The fix is to either set the bank to 0
explicitly on driver load, or to stop assuming that bank is 0 by
default. My patch does the latter, as it might also help in case
something is later doing concurrent accesses to the chip.

This is from the standard default sensors configuration file. It is
expected that you tweak the labels, limits etc. to match your own
motherboard.

The driver is supposed to pick the best divider if you set the min fan
speed limits properly (which it seems you didn't.) If you don't set the
min limits, all the driver will do is increase the divider as long as
it gets a 0 reading, so the dividers will be good, but not necessarily
optimum.

Don't assume that the default bank is 0. For one thing, we don't even
set it to 0 when the driver is loaded, so the initial state might be
different. For another, something (say, the BIOS) might access the chip
and leave with the bank set to something different, so assuming that
the bank value is 0 is not safe.
