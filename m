Thank you for the reason. Yes, people upgrading libsensors would be 
preferred and this issue should show up in google now.

Frankly, if I had gone to the lm-sensors homepage and had seen a fixed 
2.x version available I'd no doubt have shrugged it off then and there 
so I might as well do so now that Delvare announced that it's _going_ to 
be there real soon. 2.10.7 should be painless enough as an upgrade, it's 
needing lm-sensors 3.0(.2) and all its listed accompanying patches to 
programs depending on libsensors which triggered this thread.

So, <shrug>. I know how to fix my own systems, others will be able to 
find out and once lm-sensors 2.10.7 is available, it's not a big deal 
anymore.

That said, here's the "make it optional" patch tweaked according to your 
comments. Feel free to drop it on the floor...

Rene.

Subject: [PATCH] acpi/thermal: allow disabling of thermal zone hwmon support

2.6.26-rc gained a hwmon interface to the Thermal Zone driver
which unfortunately breaks lm-sensors 2 userspace and renders
all other (subsequent) hwmon sensors inoperable also.

Many systems, current slackware and derivative systems among
them, are using lm-sensors 2 and would be affected. A new
lm-sensors 2.10.7 release is needed to fix this from the user
side.

This makes the hwmon support optional (enabled by default) and
comments that it needs a new enough lm-sensors userspace. This
also immediately schedules the option for removal again as this
is only intended to not break systems over the 2.6.26 upgrade
when new enough lm-sensors is not yet available or widely
deployed.
