I'm still not keen on placing these intervals in the dt. Why can the
kernel not choose sensible values?

I'm not sure it makes sense to group this data within a property. We
might need to extend this in future and it might not be possible to
extend this unambiguously. It may make more sense as a sub-node or
collection of properties.

How do the upper and lower bounds in the cooling-devices property
interact with temperatures described in the trips node?

I'm confused what are the cooling device min and max limits? Where are
they defined if not in the lower bound and upper bound entries of the
cooling-devices property?

I still don't see why it's not possible to do this dynamically. I am not
entirely convinced this is part of the hw spec.

I assume you mean the sensors property? That looks fine to me, though we
may need to specify the way sensors relate to temperatures in trip
points and cooling device properties -- do those temperatures correspond
to an average of sensors readings, min/max, etc?

I'm not keen on the mixed bag of values in the cooling-device property,
as it's difficult to extend in future if necessary. I think we may need
cells for cooling devices -- what if a single fan controller controls
fans in different thermal zones?

I'm also not keen on devices being described as their own cooling
device, as I think this is more difficult to support than not listing a
cooling device -- it'll have to be special-cased anyway.

Here we have a set of sensors, but no relationship between these sensors
and the trips or cooling-devices are described. How does that work?

I think that the above can describe that, but I'd like to see a binding
document so we can consider it in more detail.
