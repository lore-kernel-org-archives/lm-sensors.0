The application has to display something like "24 °C below the limit",
so how should it know that the 70°C should be named "the limit"?

To use an example, my CPU has these entries like these:
temp1_input: 29875
temp1_max: 70000
temp1_crit: 95000
temp1_crit_hyst: 92500

How should these entries be displayed?
(we know that: "40.1 °C below limit", "limit", "25 °C above limit" etc.)

But what algorithm should the application (or libsensors) use to create
those labels?  If we have "temp1_relative: 70000", then this happens to
be the "max" limit; but what if some CPU vendor decides to define, e.g.,
the value 0 as the "normal" operating temperatire, so that the entries
would look like this:
temp1_input: -1000
temp1_max: 40000
temp1_relative: 0
Should the values be labeled as "1 °C below normal" and "40 °C above
normal", and how should the application know that 0 is to be labeled
"normal"?  It might make more sense to display the temperature just as
"41 °C below max", in which case the actual value of temp1_relative is
not used at all.

"Relative" means that any value is meaningful only in comparison with
other values/limits, so it does not make sense to declare one point on
the scale as base.

> Additionally it wouldn't fit in libsensors as it exists today.

Then the best bet would probably be an entry like temp#_unit, with
0 = absolute °C (default); 1 = relative °C or °K; other values
"unknown".  Even if some silly scale is introduced later, applications
that read this entry then know that they must not display a unit like °C
for unknown unit specifications.


Best regards,
Clemens
