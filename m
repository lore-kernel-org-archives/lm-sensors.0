The concept of defining hard thermal limits in DT certianly seems
reasonable.

From a quick look at the version on lkml [1], it seems like this leaks a
Linux implementation details (e.g. governer names) into the binding, and
I think that the linkage of devices to thermal zones should be definedd
more explicitly. A reposting of the series to devicetree (and lakml?)
would be helpful for review.

Thanks,
Mark.
