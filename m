When performing some searches I find messages going back to at least
september 2006 [1] [2]. With multiple occurences of these patches being
"dusted off". They never got applied though, and for that (*not*
applying them) I cannot find any reason. Is there any? Or did people
just become uninterested and let the patches "collect dust"?

Then regarding Alan's patch. The fact that it is a *lot* simpler than
Jim Cromie's SuperIO locks coordinator is IMHO a significant advantage
over the latter. Furthermore, "lock coordinator" seems like a bad name
to me, since those patches seem especially concerned with centralising
the way that SuperIO devices are probed for. Thus if the only thing
required is to serialize resource access I think plain-ol' locking
(with the ability to block on the lock, rather than polling for it).
