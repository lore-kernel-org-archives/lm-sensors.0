What does this mean? Is the binding expected to change in incompatible
ways?

I see we have similar wording at the top of the clock bindings, which
should probably go -- it's ABI now...

More odd spacing. There's a fair amount later that would be nice to fix
up too.

There seems to be some confusion as to the word "specifier". Typically,
a specifier is all the cells after the phandle described by the #*-cells
property for the node pointed to. So here there is one
cooling-specifier, which describes the min and max values, and possibly
some other values.

How does that work with an unsigned value? Does the code check for
0xffffffff, or compare against -1?

Is this when performing passive cooling, or any passive or above (i.e.
any cooling whatsoever)?

The type and the description don't agree here. The type description can
probably be omitted as the description describes the format of the
property.

Was there a reason for adding this?

There was some confusion over my request for cooling-specifier and
thermal-sensor-specifier terminology last time [1]. I was simply asking
for terminology, not -names properties.

Ah, so any coolnig implies the passive polling delay. That makes teh
naming confusing (active cooling means we're polling for the passive
delay). Sorry for the poor suggestion.

How about having polling-delay-cooled instead. That better describes
when it applies.

It would be nice to have another line break here.

I assume thermal-zones appears under /, rather than under a subnode? It
might be worth mentioning.

If we're going to give an example of cpu nodes with cooling-cells, we
should have a binding for cpu nodes explaining what the abstract cooling
properties mean for them.

What _specifically_ do each of the values 0,1,2,3 mean here? Are they
indexes of OPPs to use (which aren't shown in the example)? Are they
specific to a particular CPU (the compatible string for which is not
shown in the example)? Are they generic and applicable to all CPUs
somehow?

Having a comment inline describing this fictional sensor would be
useful, something like:

	/*
	 * A simple fan controlller. Supports 10 speeds of operation
	 * (represented as 0-9).
	 */

I didn't notice the block below until already having tried to comprehend
the example. Inline comments would help in that regard.

Similarly, it would be nice to have something here like:

	/*
	 * A simple IC with a single bandgap temperature sensor.
	 */

This should be under a thermal-zones node. Similarly for the other
examples, they should have all relevant context.

This got changed to a string in the binding, but is a CPP value here.

This is a little difficult to understand. How about:

In the example above, the ADC sensor (bandgap0) at address 0x0000ED00 is
used to monitor the zone 'cpu-thermal' using its sole sensor. A fan
device (fan0) is controlled via I2C bus 1, at address 0x48, and has ten
different cooling states 0-9.

The reference to bandgap.sensor0 is confusing. How about saying
<&bandgap 0> instead? It makes it far easier to see correspondence
between the text and the dt. Similarly for the other instances below.

I mentioned this last time, and it's tripped me up again while reading:
It's rather too easy to read "fw" as "firmware" and get confused.

s/fw/framework/ please. :)

For the moment it might be worth printing a warning if args_count > 1,
as thermal management might not function correctly.
