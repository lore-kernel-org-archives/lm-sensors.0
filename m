Right, I downloaded 2.9.1 and did make user and make user_install.  This 
is still on 2.6.11 as going back to 2.4 on this box isn't desirable (the 
box is in a remote datacenter).

Output is attached, but this is probably what you're looking for:

Probing for `Winbond W83792D'... Success!
    (confidence 7, driver `to-be-written'), other addresses: 0x4b 0x4f

Looks like your guess paid off :)

So I guess my next qustion is...what's the timeline for porting this 
driver to 2.6?

Many thanks,
Jon.

This program will help you determine which I2C/SMBus modules you need to
load to use lm_sensors most effectively. You need to have i2c and
lm_sensors installed before running this program.
Also, you need to be `root', or at least have access to the /dev/i2c-*
files, for most things.
If you have patched your kernel and have some drivers built in, you can
safely answer NO if asked to load some modules. In this case, things may
seem a bit confusing, but they will still work.

It is generally safe and recommended to accept the default answers to all
questions, unless you know what you're doing.

 We can start with probing for (PCI) I2C or SMBus adapters.
 You do not need any special privileges for this.
 Do you want to probe now? (YES/no): y
Probing for PCI bus adapters...
Use driver `i2c-i801' for device 00:1f.3: Intel 82801FB ICH6
Probe succesfully concluded.

We will now try to load each adapter module in turn.
Module `i2c-i801' already loaded.
If you have undetectable or unsupported adapters, you can have them
scanned by manually loading the modules before running this script.

 To continue, we need module `i2c-dev' to be loaded.
 If it is built-in into your kernel, you can safely skip this.
 i2c-dev is not loaded. Do you want to load it now? (YES/no): y
 Module loaded succesfully.

 We are now going to do the adapter probings. Some adapters may hang halfway
 through; we can't really help that. Also, some chips will be double detected;
 we choose the one with the highest confidence value in that case.
 If you found that the adapter hung after probing a certain address, you can
 specify that address to remain unprobed. That often
 includes address 0x69 (clock chip).

Next adapter: SMBus I801 adapter at 0500
Do you want to scan it? (YES/no/selectively): y

Some chips are also accessible through the ISA bus. ISA probes are
typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
this. This is usually safe though.

Some Super I/O chips may also contain sensors. Super I/O probes are
typically a bit more dangerous, as we have to write to I/O ports to do
this. This is usually safe though.

 Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
 Just press ENTER to continue: 

Driver `to-be-written' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500'
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x2f (and 0x4b 0x4f)
    Chip `Winbond W83792D' (confidence: 7)

Driver `eeprom' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500'
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x50
    Chip `SPD EEPROM' (confidence: 8)
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500'
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x51
    Chip `SPD EEPROM' (confidence: 8)

Driver `smbus-arp' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * Bus `SMBus I801 adapter at 0500'
    Busdriver `i2c-i801', I2C address 0x61
    Chip `SMBus 2.0 ARP-Capable Device' (confidence: 1)

Driver `w83627hf' (should be inserted):
  Detects correctly:
  * ISA bus address 0x0290 (Busdriver `i2c-isa')
    Chip `Winbond W83627THF Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)


 I will now generate the commands needed to load the I2C modules.
 Sometimes, a chip is available both through the ISA bus and an I2C bus.
 ISA bus access is faster, but you need to load an additional driver module
 for it. If you have the choice, do you want to use the ISA bus or the
 I2C/SMBus (ISA/smbus)? smbus

To make the sensors modules behave correctly, add these lines to
/etc/modules.conf:

#----cut here----
# I2C module options
alias char-major-89 i2c-dev
#----cut here----

To load everything that is needed, add this to some /etc/rc* file:

#----cut here----
# I2C adapter drivers
modprobe i2c-i801
modprobe i2c-isa
# I2C chip drivers
# no driver for Winbond W83792D yet
modprobe eeprom
# Warning: the required module smbus-arp is not currently installed on your system.
# For status of 2.6 kernel ports see http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/supported.html
# If driver is built-in to the kernel, or unavailable, comment out the following line.
modprobe smbus-arp
modprobe w83627hf
# sleep 2 # optional
/usr/local/bin/sensors -s # recommended
#----cut here----

WARNING! If you have some things built into your kernel, the list above
will contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones! You really should
try these commands right now to make sure everything is working properly.
Monitoring programs won't work until it's done.

Do you want to generate /etc/sysconfig/lm_sensors? (yes/NO): no
