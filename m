Hi Simon,

2.6.39 is pretty old. It doesn't include the new mei driver (which is now
in drivers/misc/mei).

Is it that much different that it would require a separate driver, especially
if it is almost identical ?

It also hides possible error cases, though, and makes review very complicated.
You would be better off using function parameters as much as possible. Plus,
after all, it is not correct that you avoid duplicate code. You only avoid
duplicate source code. Fore that, the additional cost (in terms of risk and
maintainability) is pretty high.

2.6.39 does not include the new mei driver, so I don't think you can make
that claim.

I would suggest to have a look into the new driver and work with its
maintainer to make it better suitable for other drivers if needed.
Its main deficiency, as far as I could see when I looked into it, is that it
doesn't support out-of-directory drivers very well - which means the hwmon
driver might have to reside in drivers/misc/mei instead of drivers/hwmon.
Not an optimal solution, but better than nothing.

Is that really necessary ? Changing the ABI/API to userland is always
problematic.

You might want to run your code through checkpatch and fix all errors and
warnings. The major problem, though, is that we can not have two instances
of mei core code in the kernel.

Copying the mei driver maintainer and the kernel mailing list for additional
input.

Thanks,
