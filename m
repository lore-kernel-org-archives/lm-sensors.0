I like your implementation, it's nice. Thanks for coming up with this
idea. The only change I would propose is to make the last parameter of
the read_io and write_io callback functions a device * instead of a
void *. This would let the compiler check the types and avoid improper
casts.

One bug in your code:

You want to check that conflict->res_ops->read_io exists, not write_io.

This port forwarding approach is interesting, maybe even beyond the
ACPI case we are trying to solve here. However, it has some drawbacks:

1* It requires that we modify each driver individually. It's quite a
shame that we have to update drivers all around the kernel tree with
specific code to workaround a problem which is originally located in a
single place (the ACPI subsystem.) That being said this isn't a blocker
point, if this is the only way, we'll do it. But that's a rather great
amount of work.

2* It seems to incur a signficant performance penalty.
____request_resource isn't cheap as far as I know. And in the
absence of conflict, you are even allocating and releasing the resource
on _each_ I/O operation, which certainly isn't cheap either. Again, it
is not a blocker point, after all this is a workaround for an improper
behavior of the acpi subsystem, this performance penalty is the price to
pay. But there is also a performance penalty for legitimate I/O access,
which worries me more.

3* What about concurrent accesses from ACPI itself? Unless we have a
guarantee that only one kernel thread can run AML code at a given
moment, I can imagine a conflict happening, as your code protects us
well against ACPI and driver concurrent accesses, but not against two
concurrent ACPI accesses. But I'm not familiar with ACPI - maybe we do
have this guarantee? OTOH, if this ever happens, well, it would happen
even without your code.

So for now I tend to think that the idea of a global AML lock proposed
by Pavel Machek and Bodo Eggert would be more efficient. And it
wouldn't need any driver-specific code, so it would be much more simple
to implement. The drawback being that we serialize more than we really
need to (e.g. the hardware monitoring driver will not be allowed to
access the chip when _any_ AML code is running, not just when the AML
code accesses the hardware monitoring chip, and if two drivers want to
check the AML lock, they'll exclude each other as well.) But I wonder
if this is a problem in practice. Maybe we'll have to make some
profiling on both solutions and compare.

Thanks,
