Newer i2cdump skips the 5-second warning when given -y, that's all.

(snip tons of results)

Thanks for sending all that.  I see one bug clearly, and I'm pretty close to
seeing the other one.  But for tonight, I need sleep.

In the meantime, please try this command as root, against the newer kernel,
*after* you've done 'sensors -s':

	# i2cset -f 0 0x2d 0x5d 0x0e b

I'm pretty sure you'll see the correct temps.

Regards,
