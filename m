Yes, plus another 200+ files to remove the then-unnecessary existing pr_fmt defines.

Sounds like the ~400 definitions of TRUE and FALSE in the code base I am working with here.

My take is that the time to reach such an agreement is now, to avoid cluttering more code
with pr_fmt defines. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will get to reach an agreement,
since more and more subsystems will be affected.

Personally, I think the pr_fmt cleanup should be more important than replacing printk
with pr_<level>. But I'll defer to Jean's judgement on this one, and follow his lead.
