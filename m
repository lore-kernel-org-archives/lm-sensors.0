Hello Jean,

I will try to complement what Rui's already commented.

In fact, I would agree with you that it is not common to see such
devices. What I've already seen is that HW provides is usually artifacts
that may help on computing such statistic data. And in that case it may
be the case that the data coming from the HW may have less noise, such
as system overhead, than that computed by the caller.

However, it is also the case that such artifacts do not work without a
proper platform dependent configuration step, such as update interval
and size of the history window.

Just a complementary point here, The design of current thermal framework
is so that get_trend is zone specific, and thus, it has to consider the
cooling strategy owned by the driver, like the update interval. And
besides, in case the driver does not know how to compute the trend, the
framework, the caller of that callback, also provides default behavior.

The purpose of this series is to split the data that is platform
dependent and allow designers to write those data points in device tree.
That is why the "glue layer" still keeps the get_trend.

Maybe your concern is the fact that it would be very hard to provide a
trend from a hwmon driver? And that I agree, unless the device provides
artifacts. But that is not the case for all users of this API. For
instance, some versions of TI SoC bandgap sensors may have historical
buffers and cumulative values. But obviously, these features would work
only if proper configuration is agreed.

Agreed here. However, the caller can also instruct the device to help on
the computation based on historical values. And historical values can be
configured also by the caller.

You have got to be excited about what you are doing. (L. Lamport)
