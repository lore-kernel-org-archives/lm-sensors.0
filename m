I'm thinking that it might be an idea to also use this idea of udev autoloading 
through DMI info for the abituguru and abituguru3 driver (review please). The 
both only support about 12 motherboards. For the abituguru driver, dmi info 
could also be used to automatically set the module options needed on the 2 
oldest uguru featuring abit motherboards. What do you think about this?
