I would prefer the first of those. Second might be an option too
if that is not possible.

From a technical perspective. Hard to see what a PCI bridge ID has to do with Tjmax.

You are right, functionality would change if someone runs a kernel with PCI undefined 
on the specific systems which do use the PCI bridge ID to determine Tjmax. So 
if there are no other options, maybe the big fat warning in that case would make sense.
I would definitely prefer that over disabling coretemp entirely just because it _might_
possibly report a wrong Tjmax (which it doees anyway for many CPUs).
