Just for clarification - you mention a number of sensors, but unless
I am missing something only the package sensor is implemented. Is that correct ?

From the code, it seems that negative values can be reported. Is it guaranteed 
by the chip that (TjMax - MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET) >= 0 ? Otherwise, the
minimum temperature would be (TjMax - 127).

Your driver bails out at TjMax >= 120, so there is some inconsistency.
Also, it seems that this is not a constant, since you are reading
MSR_IA32_TEMPERATURE_TARGET to get the value.

Since the CPUs supporting the package sensor presumably also all support
reading TjMax, maybe you can reword the above text to reflect this.

Pysical --> Physical.
I would suggest to drop the "id" for consistency. Core sensor names don't
include "id" either.

I am not sure if "physical" should be included in the first place.
Also, above description suggests that future CPUs might add more sensors.
If so, the name should probably reflect the location of the current sensor,
ie be something like "Package core X" or "Core package X" or "Package X (core)".
