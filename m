Yes, these are alarms. _min and _max are really misnomers, these should
have been _low and _high but by the time I realized it, _min and _max
were already de facto standards and it was too late to change this.

Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface says:

Usual items are "input" (measured value), "max" (high threshold,
"min" (low threshold).

Specific occurrences are then left without details. If you think this
document can be improved, I welcome patches.
