No, we developed a new governor named as "pid governor", it manages
thermals based on output values of PID controller.

Indeed, our thermal management includes skin-temp, soc-thermal,
cpu-throttle driver and pid governor. This pach set is prepared for the
skin-temp driver.
As you know the tegra soc-therm is in upstreaming, and we will post
other drivers step by step.

Thanks.
