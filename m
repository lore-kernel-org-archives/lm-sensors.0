Yeah, I see your point. But I avoided describing cooling state as a
property, as you are requesting, because in fact it is not a property.
Its min and max values are properties, as you can see in the document.
Describing cooling state as a property in this document will confuse
people, because it won't be used in any part of the hardware description.=

Mark R. has already requested this example and I already wrote it. There
is a comment in the CPU example session explaining exactly what you are
asking. Have you missed that one?

Not it is in fact not. These concepts are derived from an specification
that is there for decades actually, ACPI. I am not reinventing the wheel
here. There are several platforms based on that specification. The
concepts have been reused on top of non-ACPI platforms too.

It would be less representative and not standardized. Do you have a
class of boards, or at least a single board that is using the proposed
standard?

So, I still don't understand what is wrong with the binding, as it is
supposed to cover the situations you are talking about. I really don't
see to where this discussion is leading to.

Which are completely different devices and concepts.

Because it is not about making using cases to work, but describing the
hardware thermal limits.
