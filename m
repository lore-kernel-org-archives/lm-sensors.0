Guess that explains it. Thanks a lot for the note.

Too much spam out there lately, and small providers (like mine) get caught in
the middle. I tried AT&T / Yahoo, but they tend to reject patch series
as spam. So looks like I am caught between a rock and a hard place. On top
of that there is Google and its policies, which seem to target small providers;
I can not send any e-mail to a Google recipient (anyone@google.com) when using
my primary provider. One has to wonder if there is a conflict of interest
somewhere.
