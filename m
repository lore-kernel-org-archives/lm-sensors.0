This is only available on raw I2C messages, not on the higher-level
i2c_smbus_*() API. And not all bus drivers support it. And that's not
what is needed here anyway: ignoring the nack means we would continue
reading from the chip, while it really doesn't want to talk to us at
that time.

You should check for -ENXIO explicitly. According to
Documentation/i2c/fault-codes, this is the value bus drivers should
return on missing Ack.

Do you really have to trigger the Nack for the ADC conversion to start?
Can't you just use i2c_smbus_read_byte() (no _data) for the first part
of the transaction?
