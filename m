If you had tested your patch on real or simulated hardware,
you might have noticed a crash whenever you accessed any
of the attributes. So you did not test your patch.

Instead of trying to educate you how the conversion to the
new API works, I decided to help you out a bit and do
the conversion myself. I did some cleanup before, since
that made the actual feature patch easier for me to implement,
and I did some more cleanup afterwards just because I like
cleaning up code.

I had hoped that you might find the time to test the result,
but it appears that won't happen. I am gracious to Jean that
he took the time to review the changes and even test the
result in simulation, even though I know he is very busy.
So I consider the changes to be good enough to be made
available in my -staging tree, which I did by now.
I'll move them over to -next once I have the chance to test
on real hardware or after I get a Tested-by: from someone
with real hardware.
