Hi Arnaud,

that is interesting; I thought it is Yet Another Clone, not really exactly
the same chip.

Depends on what you need. The fault_queue and mode sysfs attributes are neither
necessary nor  acceptable - hwmon has well defined attributes, and new ones
are only added after discussion. If you _need_ to configure polarity,
interrupt mode, or fault queue depth in your application to anything but
the default, we might discuss adding those as devicetree properties.
However, you would have to make sure that it does not negatively affect
the other chips supported by the driver, and we should then discuss
if other properties should be supported as well. Overall, I strongly suspect
that the HW is happy with the default configuration. If so, we should just leave
it alone.

Power control (the shutdown attribute) should be handled through the PM
subsystem; see CONFIG_PM / CONFIG_PM_SLEEP in other drivers. If your hardware
can sleep (which may be somewhat unlikely for a NAS), you could add support
for it to the driver. That is the one improvement I could think of that
might make sense.

Thanks,
Guenter
