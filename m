Hi Nicolas,

Sorry for the delay.

First of all, please read Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-documentation, and
rename the entries to match the standard names whenever possible. Also
make sure that you use the standard units. If you use the standard
names and units and if you register your device with the hwmon class,
standard monitoring application will be able to support your driver.

Some old hardware monitoring drivers are still doing this, but this is
strongly discouraged for new drivers. It is possible (and easy) to
avoid using such macros, by sharing callback functions between various
sysfs files.

This is done by using SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR instead of DEVICE_ATTR to
declare the sysfs attributes. It takes an extra parameter, which is the
entry number/index. You retrieve that index in the callback function:

static ssize_t show_temp(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *devattr,
			 char *buf)
{
	struct sensor_device_attribute *attr = to_sensor_dev_attr(devattr);
	int nr = attr->index;
	(...)
}

Take a look at the hwmon/f71805f.c driver for examples.

This is considered a bad practice, as in theory you driver shouldn't
create the device by itself, and the files are associated to the device,
not the driver. All hardware monitoring drivers have been fixed now, so
please add the file removal calls in your driver too. You might find it
easier to use file groups rather than individual files. Again, see for
example the f71805f driver, and in particular the f71805f_attributes
array and f71805f_group structure, and the sysfs_create_group() and
sysfs_remove_group() calls.

I'm sorry but I really don't have the time for a complete review of
your driver.
