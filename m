To add to this: The datasheet clearly states that the pins are GPIO pins,
three of which can be configured as ALERT output, ALL_ON input, or clock
input/output. GPIO pins should be made available to the kernel through
the GPIO subsystem; any clock configuration should be configured through the
clock subsystem if needed. The pin configuration as ALERT output/ALL_ON
input/clock is clearly board specific and should thus be provided as
platform data and/or devicetree data if needed.

The existing GPIO alarm attributes should be removed. The pin values should be
reported as GPIO pin values instead.
