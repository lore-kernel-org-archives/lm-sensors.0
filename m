Hi Laszlo,

In Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface:

*********************
* Global attributes *
*********************

name		The chip name.
		This should be a short, lowercase string, not containing
		spaces nor dashes, representing the chip name. This is
		the only mandatory attribute.
		I2C devices get this attribute created automatically.

It is documented since August 2007 [1], and stop with this tone,
please. The more you talk, the less I want to help you. Guenter already
gave up on you, I might as well do the same.

I did not "make" the decision, it is a limitation implied by the way
libsensors creates unique and persistent identifiers for hwmon devices.
These identifiers are of the form ${name}-${bus}-${address}, where
${bus} can (but doesn't have to) be of the form ${type}-${number}. If
${name} contains a dash then parsing the identifier becomes ambiguous,
as you can no longer easily tell where ${name} ends and where ${bus}
begins.

There's nothing unreasonable about the situation. Yes, compatibility
matters, it matters a lot even, and we do our best to guarantee that
users can move to a more recent kernel without breaking anything that
was previously working. I certainly hope other open source project
maintainers and developers do the same.

I already explained (but apparently you were to busy yelling at Guenter
and myself to notice) that the hwmon device name (which is the one we
can't change) can now be dissociated from the i2c (or platform) device
name, thanks to Guenter's excellent work. This is exactly the solution
to your problem, so there's no need sound dramatic.

You can't always anticipate this kind of thing. If you wait until
you're certain your design (and code) is perfect and will never need
to be changed, then you'll never release any piece of software. That
code you just wrote and submitted, and you believe is perfect, guess
what? Next year someone will call it crap and blame it on you for not
putting enough thinking into it.

There was little reason to believe that the max6650 driver would become
a MFD driver at the time is was written (10 years ago [2].) The concept
of MFD driver did not even exist then. We have several hwmon drivers
implementing side features (such as watchdog) without using the MFD
framework. I still believe using the MFD framework to support the
MAX6650 and MAX6651 is overkill, BTW, so even today I wouldn't
anticipate it. Which does _not_ mean I'll reject the attempt to do so,
contrary to what you repeatedly claimed in various posts of this
discussion.

You sent one patch, I reviewed it, found it was broken, and explained
why. In great details, I believe. Did you actually read my review? Did
you understand it?
