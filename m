While I test-booted 2.6.22(-rc) yesterday I had a look into the BIOS
setup.  There is a fan speed control based on a temperature threshold,
separately for CPU fan and case fan.  The thresholds are currently 55=B0C
and 50=B0C respectively.

During the time I spent in the BIOS setup, the CPU fan speed was
displayed as something more than 1400, and the case fan speed was
displayed as 0.  The latter is AFAIK typical with slow fans.

Yes, years of reliance on pocket calculators did that to me.

Will try it in a minute.

I now updated to Gentoo's ksensors-0.7.3-r1 (which is v0.7.3 plus
patches from Debian) and lm_sensors-2.10.4, added

    ignore fan5
    set fan1_min    200
    set fan2_min    1000
    set fan3_min    0

to sensors.conf, compiled the drivers with CONFIG_HWMON_DEBUG_CHIP=3Dy,
and "sensors" alone seems to behave fine now.  Or maybe it did so
already before that.  But as soon as I start "ksensors", "sensors" shows
that the CPU fan divider suddenly changed from 8 to 128.  "sensors -s"
will then cause the kernel to log
    w83627ehf w83627ehf.656: fan2 clock divider changed from 128 to 8
    w83627ehf w83627ehf.656: fan3 low limit and alarm disabled
and sensors will show the correct CPU fan speed again --- but soon after
that the divider will go up to 128 again if ksensors is running in parallel.

If I quit ksensors and run "sensors -s", sensors will continue to show
correct speeds.  Actually with ksensors running, "while sensors | grep
'CPU Fan'; do sleep .2; done" shows that the CPU fan divider oscillates
between 8 and 128 in ca. 5 seconds long periods:  16 times in a row it
prints div =3D 8, and 8 times it prints div =3D 128, then div =3D 8 again, =
and
so forth.  There are no dmesg messages during all that.

ksensors has different update interval settings, and although I had the
w83627ehf readings configured to be updated every 30 seconds, some
seemingly unrelated setting was at 5 seconds.  I changed that to 30
seconds too and the period of above loop increased to ca. 30 seconds
(127 times div =3D 8, 8 times div =3D 128).

So the BIOS seems innocent.
