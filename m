Another idea just came to my mind:
Not reserving the ACPI variables/OperationRegions at all in
kernel/resources.c. Instead store these in a list in drivers/acpi/osl.c
as I've already done and add something at the beginning of:
kernel/resources.c:request_region()
like (pseudo-code):
#ifdef ACPI
    err = check_for_acpi_operation_region_clashes(struct *resource)
    if (err)
	...
#endif
this should be the most unintrusive way, (nearly) not polluting
kernel/resources.c
and in drivers/acpi/osl.c:
check_for_acpi_operation_region_clashes(struct *resource){
   ...
   if (clash)
      if (acpi_enforce_resources = LAX)
          pr_info ("Resource %s might interfere with ACPI"
                   " Operation region %s\n", ...);
          return no_error;
      else {
          printk (KERN_ERR "Resource %s interferes with ACPI"
                   " Operation region %s\n", ...);
          return error;
      }
 ...
}

Will try a bit more..., I will still read mails next week...

Thanks,
