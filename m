libsensors 3 will never support chip-specific extensions. We've been
there with libsensors 2, it was a nightmare, never again please.

This doesn't mean we can't have chip-specific extensions, and actually
some drivers have such extensions already. But as they are often
undocumented and bound to be replaced by standard implementations in
the future, nobody should rely on them. Which makes their usefulness
dubious.

This is the reason why I always insist on trying to define a standard
suitable for all chips before you think of adding a not-yet-supported
feature to a given driver.

I'm not Jeff, but resetting the factors is a bad idea. The
BIOS/firmware might have set them up properly, so the default should be
to leave them untouched (as we do with every other setting.)

I'm not giving my ack for any non-standard feature, sorry.
