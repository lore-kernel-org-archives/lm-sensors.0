I've found this thread now. Why can't we totally remove probing from
i2c-mpc? These are embedded systems, not open boxes like a PC. If a
i2c client hasn't been converted to the new model yet, convert it
before deploying with the new i2c-mpc driver.  It's not very hard to
convert the client drivers.
