It's not always sufficient to just reload the driver, especially when it's an
initialization problem as yours seems to be.  So what you're seeing there is
not too surprising.

That's because a later patch removes the i2c-isa support on which this driver
depends, prior to this patch.  If you can use git to back up, that would be
easier.

That said, I doubt the "Convert to a platform driver" is the problem.  It's
more likely the patch before that:

	hwmon/w83627ehf: Preserve speed reading when changing fan min

I'll reexamine the patch series here.  If you have time, it would help if you
could do a git bisect.  Use this command:

$ git bisect start v2.6.23-rc2 v2.6.22-rc5 drivers/hwmon/w83627ehf.c

Doing it this way will force you to reboot between tests; I think we would
need that anyway.
