No issues, I also have been there.

I agree. But coefficients are targeting in fact the steady state cases.
As described in the DT binding documentation, the case of an offset due
to sensor location distance to hotspot is a perfect usage of this propert=
y.

The thermal capacitance behavior is described, so far, most based on the
requested time requirement for each zone. Of course, this point was a
major point for discussion during this thread. Hopefully I was able to
keep the minimal time behavior requirements in the DT definition.

Yeah, but here you are maybe confusing two different constraints, and
possibly the behavior of two different zones. The current binding do not
limit you in the usage of hierarchical description. Thus, you can and
should describe two different zones to cover for two different
constraints you have in your description, one to cover for your silicon
junction (>100C) and another to cover for your case / device skin
hotspot (<45C). And in each zone you may have different limits and
thermal capacitance requirements. Pay attention that it does not mean
that you CPU (cooling) device cannot appear in two different zone. Thus
its contribution to one zone may be different to the other (each zone
can assume different coefficients).

OK. The main reason I made this property optional is exactly because
different use case may require different usage of these relations. And
possibly people may have different experience and different solutions to
the same problem. But in the end what we want is to describe the
hardware (and possibly the physics) behind the use cases. And I do
believe we have been dealing with very similar cases here.

I don't think the property is a poor abstraction. Firstly because it is
not limiting you in anything. Secondly because you may be having a
different interpretation of it, as I explained above.

In fact the thermal behavior is much more dynamic than the steady state
situation. However, so far, I haven't seen a real case that we need to
describe these dynamics deeper in DT. Including for the example you gave
above. Dealing with the history can be derived by the OS based on the
already defined properties.

> thanks,

No problem, thanks for your contribution. Again, if we are not covering
your use cases properly, let's go through them and narrow a proper
solution down.
