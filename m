It is still a good practice to split patches in this case. This makes
review and bisection easier. Simply, we don't get to apply the first
patch if we don't also apply the second.

Not yet, will do now.

BTW, as I wasn't clear enough about this originally: I didn't mean this
to fix to be included into your W83667HG-B support patch. It should be
a separate patch, so that it can be easily backported.

I will accept whatever you are willing to provide. As you're the one
spending the time, I'm not the one deciding how much you spend.

The W83667HG chip has only 3 FANOUT pins (98, 125 and 127), so it is
expected that the driver exposes only 3 pwm outputs for this chip. I
don't understand why you think it is a problem?

Pin 98 can be used for an alternative function, so the corresponding
pwm output should not even be unconditionally instantiated.

Now the chip is quite complex in that it apparently has 4 fan control
units, and which one controls which fan output can be decided by
register values. I have no idea why they made it so complex at the
hardware level, but this certainly explains why the driver is a little
messy in this respect. We might have to move 667HG and later support to
a separate driver at some point, I don't know.

Now I'm sure you understand why I never took the time to look into
adding W83667HG-B support ;)
