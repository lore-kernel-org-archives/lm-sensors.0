Yes, you are right. I can change this.

Ok, I can merge my patches.

I've added "if" here to keep the situation "as is" for all other drivers
(HP driver - hp_accel.c and spi part - lis3lv02d_spi.c. I don't have the HW to 
test) which are using the lis3 core. If we want to avoid the issues with 
unloading completely all parts should set the dev->owner. Not a problem to add 
this to HP driver and lis3lv02d_spi.c.

I tried to use the standard way of module usage control because all functions 
provided by lis3lv02d_i2c.c, lis3lv02d_spi.c or hp_accel.c can be called through 
  lis3lv02d_misc_fops file ops or joystick poll device.

I can propose another solution. We can use try_module_get(owner) during device 
registration (in lis3lv02d_add_fs()), release module by using module_put(owner) 
  after device unregister (in lis3lv02d_remove_fs()) and do not touch 
lis3lv02d_misc_fops. But anyway dev->owner should be set.

Thanks a lot for reviewing,
Yuri K
