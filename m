I expected a counter-proposal of this kind. The problem I see is that
the new limit we are adding is unrelated to _min. However, the other
_min_* file we have (_min_alarm) expresses something which is relative
to _min. Same as _max_hyst and _crit_hyst, which are relative to _max
and _critn respectively. So I have the feeling that _min_crit sends the
wrong signal to the reader. Especially if we keep _crit for the high
bound, the asymmetry raises questions.

This is my rationale for suggesting _crit and _lcrit. Now, I won't
argue forever if others disagree, these is really only a naming
convention and everything will be fine as long as the drivers and
libsensors agree.
