Step 2 did not happen. I did not get any review for my change. I
literally submitted that within a couple of hours after the request.

Could you please tell me what was wrong with that change, and why I
did not get any respect not to "xargs rm -rf" my work in that area? I
believe I was ignored instead of improving the change, and someone
else tried to address the same thing. There was no argument in that
thread. It was a technical change. I personally do not feel happy
about it.
