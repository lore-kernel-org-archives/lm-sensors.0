Yes, I can see that argument. However, a counter-point:

* I believe we do need a DT binding to describe the absolute thermal
limits of a system, for safety/correctness of system operation.

* We need to define a syntax/schema to represent that.

* If we then want to implement additional profiles with stricter limits,
do we really want to invent a different syntax/schema to represent
those? Representing them in the same way seems like good use of the
design, mind-share, etc.

* Perhaps that doesn't mean that the additional profiles have to be in
DT though; just that we somehow make any other representation of those
profiles as close to the DT representation in syntax/structure as we
can, to get maximum re-use.

To me, that sounds more like fixing a bug in the initial data, rather
than something which fundamentally affects how the data should be
represented.
