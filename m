Will change the typo.

Ditto.

Do you mean "only the core sensor"? I think the Sandy Bridge only implements
core sensor now. I would think in the future more sensors could be implemented.
If only core sensors are implemented, there is no need to have the package
level thermal hw MSRs because OS can get all package level thermal info by
enumerating all core sensors in a package.

You are right. I forgot to update this part. I'll reword it.

How about just using "package X" to align with coretemp for now? Currently there
is no interface to tell which sensor it is.

Thanks.
