I wasn't necessarily thinking of k10temp breaking a working system,
more of k10temp just not working on current systems (if we don't opt
for parallel implementations.) And there's also the coretemp case,
where we report relative values in some cases; that case would fit in
what we're discussing now, so we would modify an already existing
driver.

I think we want to, yes. I just don't know for how long.

I would love this to be true, but I can't see any reason why it would
have to be. I can easily imagine a CPU specification reading: "This
register contains a temperature value on an arbitrary scale; higher
values mean higher temperatures." I'm not claiming it would be
particularly useful... but if a CPU maker ever does this, don't we want
to support that? (This is a real question, maybe we don't.)

I really didn't expect the implementations we've seen in Intel Core or
AMD family 10h processors. So I wouldn't be surprised if future
implementations are different again.

I fail to see why the application would care about this at all. When in
relative mode, all other values would be offset by the temp#_relative
value. But that value itself would not be displayed (it has no physical
value, otherwise we wouldn't be in absolute mode, would we?)

This is taking flexibility away from us, for no benefit that I can see.
Am I missing something?

(Additionally it wouldn't fit in libsensors as it exists today. This
doesn't mean it can't be done, but the cost is higher, so it needs to
bring an significant improvement.)

Correct, and actually many drivers do that already. But the scale could
also be totally unknown (as in my theoretical example above), only
bounded by the register size (which would lead to pretty bad temp#_min
and _max IMHO.)

That would be difficult, as we generally don't know which pwm output,
if any, is related to a given CPU. ACPI may know more, but the ACPI
interface to cooling zones and temperatures is very limited IMHO, and
hard to connect to physical devices, I doubt we can get anything usable
out of it. And anyway, deciding that cooling must be somehow
proportional to temperature is pretty arbitrary and doesn't match what
I've seen people do so far.
